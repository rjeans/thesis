Acoustic Problem.
This equation is continuous as P passes through the surface S. Noting the discontinuity in the
Mk operator, indicates a mathematical definition for the quantity c(p),
Using the arguments described above, it is possible to evaluate the discontinuity properties
of all the integral equations and these are summarized below,
It is important to realize that Ma(Ф](p*) represents the limiting value of Ma(Ф](P) as P
tends to pt, whilst Mk(Q](p) represents the principal value of the integral operation; that is the
limit value of an integration over a surface S - Se, as e goes to zero.
2.3 Helmholtz' Integral Equations
2.3.1 Surface Helmholtz Integral Equation
The Surface Helmholtz' Integral equation (SHIE) forms the basis of most boundary element
methods (BEM). This equation can be derived by considering the general acoustic geometry
shown in figure (2.2). A spherical surface, Se contains two closed surface Si and S. The surface
S represents the acoustic surface of interest and the surface Si represents the surface of some
acoustic source. The domain E is the volume contained by So excluding the volume contained
by Si and S. The domain D represents the volume contained by the surface S. A small spherical
surface Se surrounds the field point P.
With the surface Se excluding the singular point P from the domain E, both the Green's
free space function and the velocity potential in E satisfy the reduced wave equation and so,
