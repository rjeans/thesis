### 2.3.3 Boundary Layer Formulations <a id="section-2-3-3"></a>

It was stated in Section 2.2 that the result of the integral operators on a continuous function defined on the surface $S$, was a solution of the acoustic wave equation. Furthermore, with the correct definition of the Green's function, the solution satisfies the radiation condition. Consequently, it is possible to define the velocity potential in the exterior domain, $E$, in terms of a single layer distribution, $\mu$,

$$\phi(P) = \mathcal{L}_k[\mu](P), \quad P \in E. \tag{2.3.13}$$

By differentiating with respect to some normal vector, defined in the exterior domain, an expression for the dimensionless velocity field is obtained.

$$\frac{\partial \phi(P)}{\partial n_p} = \mathcal{M}_k^T[\mu](P), \quad P \in E. \tag{2.3.14}$$

When the field point, $P$, is taken to the surface $S$, the boundary layer formulation for the acoustic problem is defined by,

$$\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n} = \left[\mathcal{M}_k^T - (1 - c(p))\right]\mu, \quad P \in S. \tag{2.3.15}$$

Eq. (2.3.15) can be solved to obtain the single layer density $\mu$, and then Eq. (2.3.13) can be used to evaluate the exterior and surface velocity potentials.

In a similar way, the exterior velocity potential can be defined in terms of a double layer distribution, $\sigma$,

$$\phi(P) = \mathcal{M}_k[\sigma](P), \quad P \in E. \tag{2.3.16}$$

The differentiated form is given by,

$$\frac{\partial \phi(P)}{\partial n_p} = \mathcal{N}_k[\sigma](P), \quad P \in E. \tag{2.3.17}$$

Since the $\mathcal{N}_k$ operator is continuous across the surface $S$, then Eq. (2.3.17) can be solved for $P \in S$ and the surface velocity potential is defined by,
