APPENDIX 2.
Analytical Series Solution for the Sphere
A2.1 Rigid sphere
Throughout this study the spherical radiator is used to validate the acoustic numerical
methods since an analytical solution for the spherical problem is easily available. These results
are covered in great depth by Junger and Feit [1986], and they are summarized in this appendix.
The SHIE for the exterior problem is given by,
where w is the radial displacement. If the coordinate system of the problem allows variable
separation of the Greens free space function, then an analytical solution is available. In spherical
polar coordinates the Greens free space function can be written in terms of spherical Bessel
functions and Legendre polynomials,
The coordinate system (T, 0,Ф) describes the exterior domain and (ro, Go, do) describes the
surface of the sphere. For coordinate systems where an analytical solution exists, the Green's
function in Eq. (A2.1.1) can be written as,
where l' is a solution to the homogeneous Helmholtz' equation and the normal derivative of I'
cancels the normal derivative of Ge on S. Consequently Eg. (A2.1.1) can be rewritten as,

Analytical Series Solution for the Sphere.
Taking the general case of r. = a the correct expression for g(r, ro), satisfying the homoge-
neous Neumann boundary condition and the radiation condition, is given by,
The exterior pressure field given in Eq. (A2.1.4) can now be written in terms of this modified
Green's function,
The radial displacement in Eq. (A2.1.6) can also be written as a summation of modal
displacements,
When the modal expansion of w is substituted into Eq (A2.1.7), the orthogonality of the func-
tions simplifies the expression for the exterior pressure field,
where,
The pressure on the surface of the sphere can be expressed in terms of the modal impedance,

with,
The acoustic problem interior to the spherical shell can be analyzed in a similar way.
The modified Green's function in Eq. (A2.1.5) must be constructed so that it satisfies the
homogeneous Neumann boundary condition and be finite as r → O. The corresponding surface
pressure on the interior surface is,
with,
A comparison of Eg. (A2.1.11) and Eq. (A2.1.13) shows that whilst the exterior pressure
distribution is composed of a superposition of traveling waves, the interior pressure distribution is
a superposition of standing waves. The eigenvalues of the interior spherical problem correspond
to the solutions to,
The interior eigenvalues for the spherical problem are tabulated in Table (A1.1) and the
frequency dependence of in and in is shown in figure (A2.1).

Table (A2.1). The resonant frequencies for the interior spherical Dirichlet and
Neumann acoustic problems.
For any prescribed velocity distribution on the surface of the sphere the surface pressure
distribution may be calculated using Eq. (A2.1.10). For scattering from rigid spheres the surface
velocity must be equal to zero. Therefore the fluid particle velocity of the incident wave must
cancel that of the scattered wave. From the uniqueness of the external acoustic problem, the
scattered pressure field is obtained by solving the Helmholtz' reduced wave equation with the
virtual acceleration boundary condition,
An incident plane wave can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics by using an addition
Substituting Eq (A2.1.16) into Eq. (A2.1.15), Eq. (A2.1.8) gives an expression for the axisym-
metric scattered pressure field,

Analytical Series Solution for the Sphere.
The external pressure distribution is given by,
solutions
The frequency dependence of the far field scattered pressure for an arbitrary geometry can
be approximated by asymptotic solutions. Consider Eq. (A2.1.17) in the far field,
At low frequencies the first two terms of this series expansion are O((ka)?) and the n = 2 term
is only O((ka)5). Taking the first two terms gives the far field pressure at low frequencies,
The commensurate influence of monopole and dipole radiation in the far field, and the
consequent k° dependence of the radiation amplitude is typical of Rayleigh Scatterers. A more
general consideration of such scatterers shows that at low frequencies the far field pressure
amplitude has the form,
where V is the volume and L is the characteristic dimension of the scatterer.
In the high frequency regime an approximation due to Kirchoff is appropriate. In this plane
wave approximation it is assumed that each surface element radiates as if it were in an plane
