Convert this individual section from a 1992 LaTeX academic thesis PDF to markdown format.

INDIVIDUAL SECTION INFORMATION:
- Context: Top-level chapter
- Section: 1 CHAPTER 1. Introduction
- Processing: individual chapter (pages 18-18)
- Content Type: Complete chapter with logical boundaries

EXPECTED SECTION STRUCTURE:
1 CHAPTER 1. Introduction (parent section content only)

CRITICAL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. **COMPLETE TEXT TRANSCRIPTION**: Read entire PDF content without missing any text
   - Include ALL sentences and paragraphs, especially transitional text between sections
   - Pay attention to continuation text that may appear before section headers
   - Do NOT skip connector sentences that provide context or bridge between topics
   - SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE: Any sentences that reference technical methods, formulations, or comparisons
   - Look for partial sentences or paragraphs that continue from the previous page

2. **INDIVIDUAL SECTION PROCESSING** (PARENT_SECTION_ONLY):
   - This is a complete chapter from a larger chapter
   - **CRITICAL HEADING LEVEL**: Use # for the main section header
   - Start with: # 1 CHAPTER 1. Introduction <a id="section-1"></a>
   - **PARENT SECTION CONTENT**: Extract only the main section heading (e.g., # APPENDIX 2 Analytical Solutions <a id="section-a2"></a>), and do not include any surrounding or subsequent paragraph text, unless it clearly precedes any subsection heading. If the very next content after the heading is a subsection (e.g., A2.1), then treat the parent section as heading only, with no body content.

3. **MATHEMATICAL FORMATTING**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Inline equations: $variable$ (NOT \(variable\))
   - **CRITICAL**: Display equations (unnumbered): $$equation$$ (NOT \[equation\])
   - **CRITICAL**: Display equations (numbered): $$equation \tag{2.5.1}$$ or $$\begin{align*} equation \tag{2.5.1} \end{align*}$$
   - **CRITICAL**: ALL numbered equations MUST use \tag{} inside the $$ block
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER put equation numbers outside $$ like: $$equation$$ (2.5.1)
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER use \(variable\) or \[equation\] - these are forbidden
   - **CRITICAL**: Complex superscripts/subscripts must use braces: $\lambda_N^{{e_p}}$ NOT $\lambda_N^e_p$
   - Use proper LaTeX notation for mathematical symbols and operators

**EXAMPLES:**
- Correct inline: The $N_i^k$ operator can be...
- Wrong inline: The \(N_i^k\) operator can be...
- Correct display: $$equation content \tag{4.4.1}$$
- Wrong display: \[equation content\]
- Correct complex subscript/superscript: $\lambda_N^{{e_p}}$
- Wrong complex subscript/superscript: $\lambda_N^e_p$

4. **FIGURE FORMATTING**: Use HTML picture element format with correct section-based naming:

<a id="figure-x-y"></a>

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y.png">
  <img alt="Figure X.Y. Caption text here." src="assets/figure-x-y.png">
</picture>
Figure X.Y. Caption text here.

**CRITICAL NAMING**: Use the actual section prefix in figure names:
- For Chapter 2: figure-2-1.png, figure-2-2.png
- For Appendix A2: figure-A2-1.png, figure-A2-2.png  
- For Appendix A1: figure-A1-1.png, figure-A1-2.png
**Requirements**: Anchor BEFORE picture element, both themes, full alt text, plain caption below

5. **TABLE FORMATTING**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Convert ALL tables to proper Markdown table format
   - **PRESERVE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE**: Maintain the exact layout and orientation from the PDF
   - Add anchor before table: `<a id="table-a2-1"></a>`
   - Use pipe-separated format with proper alignment:
     ```
     <a id="table-2-1"></a>
     
     | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
     |----------|----------|----------|
     | Value 1  | Value 2  | Value 3  |
     | Value 4  | Value 5  | Value 6  |
     
     **Table 2.1**: Caption text describing the table contents
     ```
   - **CRITICAL**: If the table has column headers (like n=0, n=1, n=2...), use them as column headers
   - **CRITICAL**: If the table has row labels, include them in the first column
   - Preserve all table data accurately, including numerical values and units
   - Maintain proper column alignment (left, center, right as appropriate)
   - Include complete table captions below the table
   - **DO NOT SKIP TABLES** - they contain important data that must be preserved
   - **DO NOT TRANSPOSE**: Keep rows as rows and columns as columns as shown in the original

6. **ANCHOR GENERATION AND HEADING HIERARCHY**:
   - **Chapter headers (level 1)**: # Chapter Title <a id="chapter-X"></a>
   - **Main sections (level 1)**: ## 2.1 Section Title <a id="section-2-1"></a>
   - **Subsections (level 2)**: ### 2.1.1 Subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1"></a>
   - **Sub-subsections (level 3)**: #### 2.1.1.1 Sub-subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1-1"></a>
   - **CRITICAL**: Use correct heading depth based on section numbering depth
   - Figures: <a id="figure-2-1"></a> before figure elements
   - Equations: <a id="equation-2-1"></a> before equation blocks
   - Tables: <a id="table-2-1"></a> before table content

   - Figures: [Figure 2.1](#figure-2-1), [Fig. 2.1](#figure-2-1)
   - Equations: [equation (2.1)](#equation-2-1), [Eq. (2.1)](#equation-2-1)

Introduction.
CHAPTER 1.
Introduction
1.1 Background
The acoustic analysis of submerged three dimensional structures is of great interest to en-
gineers. Such an elasto-acoustic analysis can be applied to a variety of engineering problems;
for example the determination of the sound fields generated by aircraft or underwater vehicles
and the design of transducers and acoustic shielding. The potential theory behind the acoustic
problem is also directly applicable to elasto-statics, electromagnetism, hydrodynamics, inviscid
flow and so on. In general the analysis involves solving the dynamic structural response simul-
taneously with the acoustic response, where the two are coupled by a fluid structure interaction.
Standard texts in acoustics (e.g. Junger and Feit [1986], Pierce [1989]) present well estab-
lished analytical solutions for simple structures. Morse and Feshbach (1953] list eleven coordinate
systems which allow analytical treatment and Kellog [1929) presents the classical theory behind
such analysis. Early work in acoustics concentrated on such analytical results. As an example
Wiener (1951] published results for thin plate problems and Spence and Granger [1951] presented
analytical results for rigid spheroids.
However analytical results are restricted to a narrow range of geometries. For the vast
majority of realistic problems, a closed form analytical solution does not exist. Before the advent
of digital computers, experimental testing and asymptotic approximations were the only analysis
tools available for arbitrary structures. The availability of high speed computers meant that
complex acoustic problems could be solved efficiently and accurately using numerical methods.
The finite element method (FEM) is recognized as a extremely powerful analytical tool
that can be used to solve most well defined continuum problems. It is strongly associated with
structural analysis, but its application to other areas is wide spread. Consequently it was only
natural that it should be applied to the full elasto acoustic problem and indeed much work has
been done in that area. A modern application of the FEM in acoustics is given by Pinsky and
Abboud [1990), who consider the transient analysis of the exterior acoustics problem.
A FEM analysis of the acoustic problem is hampered by a number of difficulties. The acous-
tic problems of greatest interest are often those involving a fluid of infinite extent. Discretization
