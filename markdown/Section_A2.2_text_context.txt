The frequency dependence of the far field scattered pressure for an arbitrary geometry can
be approximated by asymptotic solutions. Consider Eq. (A2.1.17) in the far field,
At low frequencies the first two terms of this series expansion are O((ka)?) and the n = 2 term
is only O((ka)5). Taking the first two terms gives the far field pressure at low frequencies,
The commensurate influence of monopole and dipole radiation in the far field, and the
consequent k° dependence of the radiation amplitude is typical of Rayleigh Scatterers. A more
general consideration of such scatterers shows that at low frequencies the far field pressure
amplitude has the form,
where V is the volume and L is the characteristic dimension of the scatterer.
In the high frequency regime an approximation due to Kirchoff is appropriate. In this plane
wave approximation it is assumed that each surface element radiates as if it were in an plane

The far field back scattered pressure is given by integrating Eq. (A2.2.4) over the illuminated
surface of the scatterer,
In Eq. (A2.2.5) the plane wave is incident along the direction of ez. Consider now the case of
a spheroid shown in figure (A2.1). For end on incidence the problem is axysymmetric and so
the cylindrical coordinate system, (M, @, Z) is appropriate to form the Kirchoff integral. In this
coordinate system, Eq. (A2.2.5) becomes,

The integral in Eq. (A2.2.11) can be done in parts, and neglecting the terms of O (kb) -1
or higher the high frequency far field back scattering amplitude is given by,
This is the result used in Chapter 4, and for the special case of the sphere, with b = a, it
reduces to the spherical result used in Chapter 3. If higher frequency terms are included an
interference pattern is introduced into the farfield result. This interference corresponds to a
path difference of 2b; ie the path difference between a specular wave at Z = -b and one at
Z = 0. The numerical results contained in this thesis show such an interfence pattern, however
the period of the fluctuations are much less than those predicted by the Kirchoff approximation.
The accepted explanation for the interference pattern (eg Varadan et al (1982]) is that they are
a result of the interference between the specular reflection at Z = -b and a Franz or creeping
wave originating at the circular cross section at b = 0. The predicted period of the interference
is given by,
where D is one half the perimeter of the spheroid in the X = 0 plane. For the various aspect
ratios used in this study this period is,

A2.3 Elastic sphere
For axisymmetric boundary conditions, there is a readily accessible analytical solution for
the dynamic elastic response of the spherical elastic shell. This solution is described in greater
depth in many standard texts, and is summarized in this appendix. Membrane and flexural
effects are included in the analytical model which can be derived from Hamilton's variational
principle. Many of the thin shell approximations used for the finite element derivation are
used for the analytical result; ie the deformation can be described in terms of the mid-shell
displacements and the mid-shell normal is remains straight after deformation.
Axisymmetric, nontortional motions are considered and the shell displacements can be
described in terms of the tangential and radial components; u, and ue. A free dynamic analysis
of the shell results in an expression for the dimensionless natural frequencies, (sh) and (5(2)?,
which are roots of a quadratic in 522,
where,
The radial or normal and the tangential displacements can be expanded in terms of Legendre
