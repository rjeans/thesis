Acoustic Problem.
As the boundary layer formulation are related to the SHIE and the DSHIE, this hybrid
formulation is analogous to the Burton and Miller formulation described above.
2.5 Thin shell formulation
A prime motivation for this project was the analysis of thin shell acoustic problems. In this
work a thin shell is defined as a shell for which the through shell displacement field is assumed
to be constant. Acoustically this means that the normal derivative of pressure is the same on
both sides of the shell.
2.5.1 Boundary integral formulation
The geometry of the thin shell is illustrated in figure (2.5). On such a shell three closely
associated points may be defined. The points are p,p, and pt, where p represents a point
midway through the thickness of the shell, pt is a point on one surface, and p is the corre-
sponding point on the other surface. The normal my is defined to be in the direction from p
to pt. The Green's function and the normal derivative of Green's function at these points will
have the following simple relationships:

Acoustic Problem.
Using these relationships, the SHIE formulation for the thin shell problem may be written as
By using the relationships in Eq. (2.5.1) and by setting @(p) = (p+) - d(P), the SHIE
and DSHIE formulations for the thin shell become,
The surface domain S is now the surface of one side of the thin shell. Since S has been
redefined the domains D and E need also to be redefined. The domain D becomes the domain
whose interface with S contains the points p, and E becomes the domain whose interface with
S contains the points pt. Both D and E are sub-domains of the exterior domain surrounding
S. Taking the limit of P to p in Eq. (2.5.3) and Eq. (2.5.4);
2.5.2 Edge conditions
When considering thin shells which do not enclose an interior volume it is important to
consider the behaviour of the integral equations at the edge of this shell. It has been proposed
in previous work (Warham (1988]) that by taking the limit of P to p in from D and E, results
in two equations that give a condition on &. However if the limits are taken correctly then,
