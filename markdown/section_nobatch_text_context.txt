Analytical Series Solution for the Sphere
A2.1 Rigid sphere
Throughout this study the spherical radiator is used to validate the acoustic numerical
methods since an analytical solution for the spherical problem is easily available. These results
are covered in great depth by Junger and Feit [1986], and they are summarized in this appendix.
The SHIE for the exterior problem is given by,
where w is the radial displacement. If the coordinate system of the problem allows variable
separation of the Greens free space function, then an analytical solution is available. In spherical
polar coordinates the Greens free space function can be written in terms of spherical Bessel
functions and Legendre polynomials,
The coordinate system (T, 0,Ф) describes the exterior domain and (ro, Go, do) describes the
surface of the sphere. For coordinate systems where an analytical solution exists, the Green's
function in Eq. (A2.1.1) can be written as,
where l' is a solution to the homogeneous Helmholtz' equation and the normal derivative of I'
cancels the normal derivative of Ge on S. Consequently Eg. (A2.1.1) can be rewritten as,
