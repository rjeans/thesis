Convert this individual section from a 1992 LaTeX academic thesis PDF to markdown format.

INDIVIDUAL SECTION INFORMATION:
- Context: Top-level chapter
- Section: A2 APPENDIX 2 Analytical Solutions
- Processing: individual chapter (pages 205-205)
- Content Type: Complete chapter with logical boundaries

EXPECTED SECTION STRUCTURE:
A2 APPENDIX 2 Analytical Solutions (parent section content only)

CRITICAL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. **COMPLETE TEXT TRANSCRIPTION**: Read entire PDF content without missing any text
   - Include ALL sentences and paragraphs, especially transitional text between sections
   - Pay attention to continuation text that may appear before section headers
   - Do NOT skip connector sentences that provide context or bridge between topics
   - SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE: Any sentences that reference technical methods, formulations, or comparisons
   - Look for partial sentences or paragraphs that continue from the previous page

2. **INDIVIDUAL SECTION PROCESSING** (PARENT_SECTION_ONLY):
   - This is a complete chapter from a larger chapter
   - **CRITICAL HEADING LEVEL**: Use # for the main section header
   - Start with: # APPENDIX 2 Analytical Solutions <a id="section-a2"></a>
   - **PARENT SECTION CONTENT**: Extract only the main section heading (e.g., # APPENDIX 2 Analytical Solutions <a id="section-a2"></a>), and do not include any surrounding or subsequent paragraph text, unless it clearly precedes any subsection heading. If the very next content after the heading is a subsection (e.g., A2.1), then treat the parent section as heading only, with no body content.

3. **MATHEMATICAL FORMATTING**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Inline equations: $variable$ (NOT \(variable\))
   - **CRITICAL**: Display equations (unnumbered): $$equation$$ (NOT \[equation\])
   - **CRITICAL**: Display equations (numbered): $$equation \tag{2.5.1}$$ or $$\begin{align*} equation \tag{2.5.1} \end{align*}$$
   - **CRITICAL**: ALL numbered equations MUST use \tag{} inside the $$ block
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER put equation numbers outside $$ like: $$equation$$ (2.5.1)
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER use \(variable\) or \[equation\] - these are forbidden
   - **CRITICAL**: Complex superscripts/subscripts must use braces: $\lambda_N^{{e_p}}$ NOT $\lambda_N^e_p$
   - Use proper LaTeX notation for mathematical symbols and operators

**EXAMPLES:**
- Correct inline: The $N_i^k$ operator can be...
- Wrong inline: The \(N_i^k\) operator can be...
- Correct display: $$equation content \tag{4.4.1}$$
- Wrong display: \[equation content\]
- Correct complex subscript/superscript: $\lambda_N^{{e_p}}$
- Wrong complex subscript/superscript: $\lambda_N^e_p$

4. **FIGURE FORMATTING**: Use HTML picture element format for dual theme support:

<a id="figure-x-y"></a>

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y.png">
  <img alt="Figure X.Y. Caption text here." src="assets/figure-x-y.png">
</picture>
Figure X.Y. Caption text here.

**Requirements**: Anchor BEFORE picture element, both themes, full alt text, plain caption below

5. **TABLE FORMATTING**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Convert ALL tables to proper Markdown table format
   - Add anchor before table: `<a id="table-a2-1"></a>`
   - Use pipe-separated format with proper alignment:
     ```
     <a id="table-2-1"></a>
     
     | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
     |----------|----------|----------|
     | Value 1  | Value 2  | Value 3  |
     | Value 4  | Value 5  | Value 6  |
     
     **Table 2.1**: Caption text describing the table contents
     ```
   - Preserve all table data accurately, including numerical values and units
   - Maintain proper column alignment (left, center, right as appropriate)
   - Include complete table captions below the table
   - **DO NOT SKIP TABLES** - they contain important data that must be preserved

6. **ANCHOR GENERATION AND HEADING HIERARCHY**:
   - **Chapter headers (level 1)**: # Chapter Title <a id="chapter-X"></a>
   - **Main sections (level 1)**: ## 2.1 Section Title <a id="section-2-1"></a>
   - **Subsections (level 2)**: ### 2.1.1 Subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1"></a>
   - **Sub-subsections (level 3)**: #### 2.1.1.1 Sub-subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1-1"></a>
   - **CRITICAL**: Use correct heading depth based on section numbering depth
   - Figures: <a id="figure-2-1"></a> before figure elements
   - Equations: <a id="equation-2-1"></a> before equation blocks
   - Tables: <a id="table-2-1"></a> before table content

7. **CROSS-REFERENCES**:
   - Figures: [Figure 2.1](#figure-2-1), [Fig. 2.1](#figure-2-1)
   - Equations: [equation (2.1)](#equation-2-1), [Eq. (2.1)](#equation-2-1)
   - Tables: [Table 2.1](#table-2-1), [Tab. 2.1](#table-2-1)
   - Sections: [Section 2.1](#section-2-1), [Sec. 2.1](#section-2-1)
   - **Literature References**: Convert ALL citation patterns to markdown links:
     * "Author [Year]" → [Author [Year]](#bib-author-year) e.g., [Jennings [1977]](#bib-jennings-1977)
     * "Author (Year)" → [Author (Year)](#bib-author-year) e.g., [Smith (1990)](#bib-smith-1990)
     * "Author et al. [Year]" → [Author et al. [Year]](#bib-author-et-al-year) e.g., [Jones et al. [1985]](#bib-jones-et-al-1985)
     * "Author and Author [Year]" → [Author and Author [Year]](#bib-author-author-year) e.g., [Burton and Miller [1971]](#bib-burton-miller-1971)

Analytical Series Solution for the Sphere.
APPENDIX 2.
Analytical Series Solution for the Sphere
A2.1 Rigid sphere
Throughout this study the spherical radiator is used to validate the acoustic numerical
methods since an analytical solution for the spherical problem is easily available. These results
are covered in great depth by Junger and Feit [1986], and they are summarized in this appendix.
The SHIE for the exterior problem is given by,
where w is the radial displacement. If the coordinate system of the problem allows variable
separation of the Greens free space function, then an analytical solution is available. In spherical
polar coordinates the Greens free space function can be written in terms of spherical Bessel
functions and Legendre polynomials,
The coordinate system (T, 0,Ф) describes the exterior domain and (ro, Go, do) describes the
surface of the sphere. For coordinate systems where an analytical solution exists, the Green's
function in Eq. (A2.1.1) can be written as,
where l' is a solution to the homogeneous Helmholtz' equation and the normal derivative of I'
cancels the normal derivative of Ge on S. Consequently Eg. (A2.1.1) can be rewritten as,
