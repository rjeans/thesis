Acoustic Problem.
Using a similar argument the SHIE for the interior problem can be derived:
In terms of integral operator notation the boundary integral equations on the surface S,
are given by,

2.3.2 Differentiated Surface Helmholtz' Integral Equation
The SHIE taken on the boundary surface may be differentiated with respect to the normal
at P to obtain the Differentiated surface Helmholtz' integral equation (DSHIE),
There is also a DSHIE for the interior problem and the differentiated integral equations can be
written in terms of integral operators,

Interior:
