INDIVIDUAL SECTION INFORMATION:
- Context: APPENDIX 2 Analytical Solutions
- Section: A2.3 Elastic Sphere
- Processing: individual chapter (pages 213-215)
- Content Type: Complete chapter with logical boundaries

EXPECTED SECTION STRUCTURE:
A2.3 Elastic Sphere

CRITICAL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. **COMPLETE TEXT TRANSCRIPTION**: Read entire PDF content without missing any text
   - Include ALL sentences and paragraphs, especially transitional text between sections
   - Pay attention to continuation text that may appear before section headers
   - Do NOT skip connector sentences that provide context or bridge between topics
   - SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE: Any sentences that reference technical methods, formulations, or comparisons
   - Look for partial sentences or paragraphs that continue from the previous page

2. **INDIVIDUAL SECTION PROCESSING** (COMPLETE_SECTION):
   - This is a complete chapter from a larger chapter
   - **CRITICAL HEADING LEVEL**: Use # for the main section header
   - Start with: # Elastic Sphere <a id="section-a2.3"></a>
   - Process the complete section content

3. **MATHEMATICAL FORMATTING**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Inline equations: $variable$ (NOT \(variable\))
   - **CRITICAL**: Display equations (unnumbered): $$equation$$ (NOT \[equation\])
   - **CRITICAL**: Display equations (numbered): $$equation \tag{2.5.1}$$ or $$\begin{align*} equation \tag{2.5.1} \end{align*}$$
   - **CRITICAL**: ALL numbered equations MUST use \tag{} inside the $$ block
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER put equation numbers outside $$ like: $$equation$$ (2.5.1)
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER use \(variable\) or \[equation\] - these are forbidden
   - **CRITICAL**: Complex superscripts/subscripts must use braces: $\lambda_N^{{e_p}}$ NOT $\lambda_N^e_p$
   - Use proper LaTeX notation for mathematical symbols and operators

**EXAMPLES:**
- Correct inline: The $N_i^k$ operator can be...
- Wrong inline: The \(N_i^k\) operator can be...
- Correct display: $$equation content \tag{4.4.1}$$
- Wrong display: \[equation content\]
- Correct complex subscript/superscript: $\lambda_N^{{e_p}}$
- Wrong complex subscript/superscript: $\lambda_N^e_p$

4. **FIGURE FORMATTING**: Use HTML picture element format with correct section-based naming:

<a id="figure-x-y"></a>

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y.png">
  <img alt="Figure X.Y. Caption text here." src="assets/figure-x-y.png">
</picture>
Figure X.Y. Caption text here.

**CRITICAL NAMING**: Use the actual section prefix in figure names:
- For Chapter 2: figure-2-1.png, figure-2-2.png
- For Appendix A2: figure-A2-1.png, figure-A2-2.png  
- For Appendix A1: figure-A1-1.png, figure-A1-2.png
**Requirements**: Anchor BEFORE picture element, both themes, full alt text, plain caption below

5. **TABLE FORMATTING**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Convert ALL tables to proper Markdown table format
   - **PRESERVE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE**: Maintain the exact layout and orientation from the PDF
   - Add anchor before table: `<a id="table-a2-1"></a>`
   - Use pipe-separated format with proper alignment:
     ```
     <a id="table-2-1"></a>
     
     | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
     |----------|----------|----------|
     | Value 1  | Value 2  | Value 3  |
     | Value 4  | Value 5  | Value 6  |
     
     **Table 2.1**: Caption text describing the table contents
     ```
   - **CRITICAL**: If the table has column headers (like n=0, n=1, n=2...), use them as column headers
   - **CRITICAL**: If the table has row labels, include them in the first column
   - Preserve all table data accurately, including numerical values and units
   - Maintain proper column alignment (left, center, right as appropriate)
   - Include complete table captions below the table
   - **DO NOT SKIP TABLES** - they contain important data that must be preserved
   - **DO NOT TRANSPOSE**: Keep rows as rows and columns as columns as shown in the original

Analytical Series Solution for the Sphere.
A2.3 Elastic sphere
For axisymmetric boundary conditions, there is a readily accessible analytical solution for
the dynamic elastic response of the spherical elastic shell. This solution is described in greater
depth in many standard texts, and is summarized in this appendix. Membrane and flexural
effects are included in the analytical model which can be derived from Hamilton's variational
principle. Many of the thin shell approximations used for the finite element derivation are
used for the analytical result; ie the deformation can be described in terms of the mid-shell
displacements and the mid-shell normal is remains straight after deformation.
Axisymmetric, nontortional motions are considered and the shell displacements can be
described in terms of the tangential and radial components; u, and ue. A free dynamic analysis
of the shell results in an expression for the dimensionless natural frequencies, (sh) and (5(2)?,
which are roots of a quadratic in 522,
where,
The radial or normal and the tangential displacements can be expanded in terms of Legendre

Analytical Series Solution for the Sphere.
For forced vibration of the spherical shell, the modal radial amplitude is related to the
modal force amplitude by,
where the modal excitation force is given by,
Finally the modal radial and tangential amplitudes are related by,
For a spherical shell vibrating in an acoustic fluid, the excitation force in Eq. (A2.3.5)
consists of the apllied force, f", modified by the fluid-structure interaction force, f". The modal
normal velocity of the submerged spherical shell is given by,
where,
Therefore by combining Eq. (A2.3.7) and Eq. (A2.3.8) the surface pressure and velocity
fields for the excited spherical shell are given by,
For the point excited spherical shell the modal excitation force is defined by,

and the resulting far field pressure field is,
The case of scattering from an elastic spherical shell is more complicated. It is necessary
to consider both the rigid body scattering component and the elastic radiated component. The
surface pressure on the rigid body due to an incident plane wave is given in Eg. (A2.1.18) with
r = a. This expression may be transformed by means of a Wronskian relationship to give,
Taking this to be the excitation force, the corresponding surface velocity distribution is arrived
at by means of the modal impedances,
The radiated far field pressure can be obtained from Eq. (A2.1.8),
The far field scattered pressure is obtained when this result is combined with the rigid-body
scattered pressure distribution, Eq. (A2.2.1). This can be expressed as a form function,
