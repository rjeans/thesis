### 2.4.3 Burton and Millerâ€™s Formulation <a id="section-2-4-3"></a>

Burton and Miller proposed [1971] that the problem of uniqueness could be overcome by forming a linear combination of the SHIE and DSHIE. This linear combination is given by,

$$\left\{ [-c(p)I + M_k] + aN_k \right\} \phi = \left\{ L_k + \alpha \left[ c(p)I + M_{k}^{I} \right] \right\} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n} - \left[ \phi_i + \alpha \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial n} \right]. \tag{2.4.4}$$

Burton and Miller demonstrated that for an imaginary coupling constant $\alpha$, this formulation should yield a unique solution for all wavenumbers.

The disadvantage of this formulation is that the kernel of the $N_k$ operator is highly singular and a method needs to be used in order to integrate this operator numerically.
