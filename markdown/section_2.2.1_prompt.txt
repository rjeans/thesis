Convert this individual section from a 1992 LaTeX academic thesis PDF to markdown format.

INDIVIDUAL SECTION INFORMATION:
- Chapter Context: CHAPTER 2. Acoustic Problem
- Section: 2.2.1 Greens Function
- Processing: Individual subsection (pages 28-29)
- Content Type: Complete subsection with logical boundaries

EXPECTED SECTION STRUCTURE:
2.2.1 Greens Function

CRITICAL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. **COMPLETE TEXT TRANSCRIPTION**: Read entire PDF content without missing any text
   - Include ALL sentences and paragraphs, especially transitional text between sections
   - Pay attention to continuation text that may appear before section headers
   - Do NOT skip connector sentences that provide context or bridge between topics
   - SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE: Any sentences that reference technical methods, formulations, or comparisons
   - Look for partial sentences or paragraphs that continue from the previous page

2. **INDIVIDUAL SECTION PROCESSING** (COMPLETE_SECTION):
   - This is a single subsection from a larger chapter
   - **CRITICAL HEADING LEVEL**: Use ### for the main section header
   - Start with: ### 2.2.1 Greens Function <a id="section-2-2-1"></a>
   - **PROCESSING SCOPE**: Process the complete section including ALL content from pages 28-29
   - Process complete logical flow from section introduction through conclusion
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage of all section content

3. **MATHEMATICAL FORMATTING**:
   - Inline equations: $variable$ (NOT \(variable\))
   - Display equations (unnumbered): $$equation$$ (NOT \[equation\])
   - Display equations (numbered): $$equation \tag{2.5.1}$$ or $$\begin{align*} equation \tag{2.5.1} \end{align*}$$
   - **CRITICAL**: ALL numbered equations MUST use \tag{} inside the $$ block
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER put equation numbers outside $$ like: $$equation$$ (2.5.1)
   - **CRITICAL**: Opening $$ must NOT have newline after it
   - **CRITICAL**: Closing $$ must NOT have newline before it

4. **FIGURE FORMATTING**: Use HTML picture element format for dual theme support:

<a id="figure-x-y"></a>

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y.png">
  <img alt="Figure X.Y. Caption text here." src="assets/figure-x-y.png">
</picture>
Figure X.Y. Caption text here.

**Requirements**: Anchor BEFORE picture element, both themes, full alt text, plain caption below

5. **ANCHOR GENERATION AND HEADING HIERARCHY**:
   - **Chapter headers (level 1)**: # Chapter Title <a id="chapter-X"></a>
   - **Main sections (level 1)**: ## 2.1 Section Title <a id="section-2-1"></a>
   - **Subsections (level 2)**: ### 2.1.1 Subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1"></a>
   - **Sub-subsections (level 3)**: #### 2.1.1.1 Sub-subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1-1"></a>
   - **CRITICAL**: Use correct heading depth based on section numbering depth
   - Figures: <a id="figure-2-1"></a> before figure elements
   - Equations: <a id="equation-2-1"></a> before equation blocks
   - Tables: <a id="table-2-1"></a> before table content

6. **CROSS-REFERENCES**:
   - Figures: [Figure 2.1](#figure-2-1), [Fig. 2.1](#figure-2-1)
   - Equations: [equation (2.1)](#equation-2-1), [Eq. (2.1)](#equation-2-1)
   - Tables: [Table 2.1](#table-2-1), [Tab. 2.1](#table-2-1)
   - Sections: [Section 2.1](#section-2-1), [Sec. 2.1](#section-2-1)
   - References: [Author (Year)](#bib-author-year)

7. **PDF TEXT GUIDANCE**: Use this extracted text to verify accuracy and completeness:

Acoustic Problem.
The consequence of this condition is that it allows outward travelling waves to be the only valid
physical solution for a radiated or scattered wave from a surface.
Eq. (2.1.10), Eq. (2.1.11) and Eq (2.1.13) uniquely define the acoustic problem. For
some simple geometries it is possible to solve the acoustic problem analytically, however for the
majority of realistic problems a numerical solution technique is needed. Analytical solutions for
certain problems are useful in establishing the accuracy of various numerical strategies used to
solve the acoustic problem.
At this stage the concept of a velocity potential function will be defined. This function
enables the fluid velocity and pressure fields to be evaluated from one potential function. The
function is defined by,
with,
2.2 Integral Operators
This work is concerned with various methods of numerical solution by means of boundary
element methods. Later in this chapter the appropriate integral equations will be der...
