Convert this individual section from a 1992 LaTeX academic thesis PDF to markdown format.

INDIVIDUAL SECTION INFORMATION:
- Chapter Context: CHAPTER 2. Acoustic Problem
- Section: 2.1 Fundamental Equations
- Processing: Individual main section (pages 25-25)
- Content Type: Complete main section with logical boundaries

EXPECTED SECTION STRUCTURE:
2.1 Fundamental Equations (parent section content only)

CRITICAL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. **COMPLETE TEXT TRANSCRIPTION**: Read entire PDF content without missing any text
   - Include ALL sentences and paragraphs, especially transitional text between sections
   - Pay attention to continuation text that may appear before section headers
   - Do NOT skip connector sentences that provide context or bridge between topics
   - SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE: Any sentences that reference technical methods, formulations, or comparisons
   - Look for partial sentences or paragraphs that continue from the previous page

2. **INDIVIDUAL SECTION PROCESSING** (PARENT_SECTION_ONLY):
   - This is a single main section from a larger chapter
   - **CRITICAL HEADING LEVEL**: Use ## for the main section header
   - Start with: ## 2.1 Fundamental Equations <a id="section-2-1"></a>
   - **PROCESSING SCOPE**: Process ONLY the parent section content - extract the section heading and any introductory text that belongs directly to 2.1 but do NOT include any subsection content
   - CRITICAL: Stop processing when you encounter the first subsection heading (e.g., 2.1.1)
   - Focus on introductory material that sets up the overall section before diving into specific subsections

3. **MATHEMATICAL FORMATTING**:
   - Inline equations: $variable$ (NOT \(variable\))
   - Display equations (unnumbered): $$equation$$ (NOT \[equation\])
   - Display equations (numbered): $$equation \tag{2.5.1}$$ or $$\begin{align*} equation \tag{2.5.1} \end{align*}$$
   - **CRITICAL**: ALL numbered equations MUST use \tag{} inside the $$ block
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER put equation numbers outside $$ like: $$equation$$ (2.5.1)
   - **CRITICAL**: Opening $$ must NOT have newline after it
   - **CRITICAL**: Closing $$ must NOT have newline before it

4. **FIGURE FORMATTING**: Use HTML picture element format for dual theme support:

<a id="figure-x-y"></a>

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y.png">
  <img alt="Figure X.Y. Caption text here." src="assets/figure-x-y.png">
</picture>
Figure X.Y. Caption text here.

**Requirements**: Anchor BEFORE picture element, both themes, full alt text, plain caption below

5. **ANCHOR GENERATION AND HEADING HIERARCHY**:
   - **Chapter headers (level 1)**: # Chapter Title <a id="chapter-X"></a>
   - **Main sections (level 1)**: ## 2.1 Section Title <a id="section-2-1"></a>
   - **Subsections (level 2)**: ### 2.1.1 Subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1"></a>
   - **Sub-subsections (level 3)**: #### 2.1.1.1 Sub-subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1-1"></a>
   - **CRITICAL**: Use correct heading depth based on section numbering depth
   - Figures: <a id="figure-2-1"></a> before figure elements
   - Equations: <a id="equation-2-1"></a> before equation blocks
   - Tables: <a id="table-2-1"></a> before table content

6. **CROSS-REFERENCES**:
   - Figures: [Figure 2.1](#figure-2-1), [Fig. 2.1](#figure-2-1)
   - Equations: [equation (2.1)](#equation-2-1), [Eq. (2.1)](#equation-2-1)
   - Tables: [Table 2.1](#table-2-1), [Tab. 2.1](#table-2-1)
   - Sections: [Section 2.1](#section-2-1), [Sec. 2.1](#section-2-1)
   - References: [Author (Year)](#bib-author-year)

Acoustic Problem.
CHAPTER 2.
Acoustic Problem
2.1 Fundamental Equations
The analysis of any acoustic problem involves the solution of a differential equation relating
fluid variables in the medium of interest, subject to certain boundary conditions. This work is
primarily concerned with the interaction of acoustic radiation with submerged structures and
the appropriate differential equation is the linear wave equation subject to a velocity boundary
condition on the submerged structure.
2.1.1 Linear Approximation
In a fundamental analysis (Pierce (1989]) of the acoustic pressure field, the linear wave
equation is developed from a consideration of mass and energy conservation. This analysis
assumes that the acoustic pressure field is a sinall amplitude perturbation to the ambient state,
characterized by those values that pressure, density and fluid velocity have when the perturbation
is absent. The fluid or acoustic medium is assumed to be homogeneous and quiescent; ie the
ambient quanti...
