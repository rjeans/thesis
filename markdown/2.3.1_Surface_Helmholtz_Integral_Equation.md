### 2.3.1 Surface Helmholtz Integral Equation <a id="section-2-3-1"></a>

The Surface Helmholtz' Integral equation (SHIE) forms the basis of most boundary element methods (BEM). This equation can be derived by considering the general acoustic geometry shown in [Figure 2.2](#figure-2-2). A spherical surface, $S_E$, contains two closed surfaces $S_i$ and $S$. The surface $S$ represents the acoustic surface of interest and the surface $S_i$ represents the surface of some acoustic source. The domain $E$ is the volume contained by $S_E$ excluding the volume contained by $S_i$ and $S$. The domain $D$ represents the volume contained by the surface $S$. A small spherical surface $S_\epsilon$ surrounds the field point $P$.

With the surface $S_\epsilon$ excluding the singular point $P$ from the domain $E$, both the Green’s free space function and the velocity potential in $E$ satisfy the reduced wave equation and so,

$$
\int_E \left( \phi(Q) \nabla^2 G_k(P, Q) - G_k(P, Q) \nabla^2 \phi(Q) \right) dV_Q = 0. \tag{2.3.1}
$$

By using Green’s formula, this volume integral may be converted to a combination of surface integrals over the surfaces bounding $E$,

$$
I_S(P) + I_{S_i}(P) + I_{S_\epsilon}(P) = 0, \tag{2.3.2}
$$

where the integrals $I(P)$ are of the form,

$$
I_S(P) = \int_{S} \left( \phi(q) \frac{\partial G_k(P, q)}{\partial n_q} - \frac{\partial \phi(q)}{\partial n_q} G_k(P, q) \right) dS_q. \tag{2.3.3}
$$

The negative sign reflects the fact that the normals are defined to point into the domain $E$.

The SHIE for an infinite exterior domain is obtained when the radius of the surface $S_E$ is taken to infinity and the radius of $S_\epsilon$ is taken to zero. By the Sommerfeld radiation condition $I_{S_\epsilon}$ will tend to zero. The integral $I_{S_i}$ has different values depending on the position of the field point $P$. For $P \in D$ its value must be zero since $I_{S_i}$ is no longer a bounding surface of $E$. For $P$ on $S$ or in $E$, its value can be evaluated in a similar way to the limiting procedures of section (1.2.2). The value of this integral as in the limit is given by,

$$
I_{S_\epsilon}(P) = 
\begin{cases} 
\phi(P) & P \in E \\
c(P)\phi(P) & P \in S \\
0 & P \in D 
\end{cases}. \tag{2.3.4}
$$

The integral $I_S$, may now be seen to be equivalent to the velocity potential that would exist in the absence of the surface $S$,

$$
I_S(P) = \phi_i(P). \tag{2.3.5}
$$

The SHIE for the infinite exterior domain can now be written as,

$$
\int_{S} \left( \phi(q) \frac{\partial G_k(P, q)}{\partial n_q} - \frac{\partial \phi(q)}{\partial n_q} G_k(P, q) \right) dS_q + \phi_i(P) = 
\begin{cases} 
\phi(P) & P \in E \\
c(P)\phi(P) & P \in S \\
0 & P \in D 
\end{cases}. \tag{2.3.6}
$$

Using a similar argument the SHIE for the interior problem can be derived:

$$
\int_{S} \left( \phi(q) \frac{\partial G_k(P, q)}{\partial n_q} - \frac{\partial \phi(q)}{\partial n_q} G_k(P, q) \right) dS_q = 
\begin{cases} 
0 & P \in E \\
-(1 - c(P))\phi(P) & P \in S \\
- \phi(P) & P \in D 
\end{cases}. \tag{2.3.7}
$$

In terms of integral operator notation the boundary integral equations on the surface $S$ are given by,

Exterior:

$$
L_k \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n} - \phi_i = [-c(p)I + M_k] \phi, \tag{2.3.8}
$$

Interior:

$$
L_k \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n} = [(1 - c(p))I + M_k] o. \tag{2.3.9}
$$
