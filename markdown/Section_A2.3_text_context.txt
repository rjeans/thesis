Analytical Series Solution for the Sphere.
A2.3 Elastic sphere
For axisymmetric boundary conditions, there is a readily accessible analytical solution for
the dynamic elastic response of the spherical elastic shell. This solution is described in greater
depth in many standard texts, and is summarized in this appendix. Membrane and flexural
effects are included in the analytical model which can be derived from Hamilton's variational
principle. Many of the thin shell approximations used for the finite element derivation are
used for the analytical result; ie the deformation can be described in terms of the mid-shell
displacements and the mid-shell normal is remains straight after deformation.
Axisymmetric, nontortional motions are considered and the shell displacements can be
described in terms of the tangential and radial components; u, and ue. A free dynamic analysis
of the shell results in an expression for the dimensionless natural frequencies, (sh) and (5(2)?,
which are roots of a quadratic in 522,
where,
The radial or normal and the tangential displacements can be expanded in terms of Legendre

For forced vibration of the spherical shell, the modal radial amplitude is related to the
modal force amplitude by,
where the modal excitation force is given by,
Finally the modal radial and tangential amplitudes are related by,
For a spherical shell vibrating in an acoustic fluid, the excitation force in Eq. (A2.3.5)
consists of the apllied force, f", modified by the fluid-structure interaction force, f". The modal
normal velocity of the submerged spherical shell is given by,
where,
Therefore by combining Eq. (A2.3.7) and Eq. (A2.3.8) the surface pressure and velocity
fields for the excited spherical shell are given by,
For the point excited spherical shell the modal excitation force is defined by,

and the resulting far field pressure field is,
The case of scattering from an elastic spherical shell is more complicated. It is necessary
to consider both the rigid body scattering component and the elastic radiated component. The
surface pressure on the rigid body due to an incident plane wave is given in Eg. (A2.1.18) with
r = a. This expression may be transformed by means of a Wronskian relationship to give,
Taking this to be the excitation force, the corresponding surface velocity distribution is arrived
at by means of the modal impedances,
The radiated far field pressure can be obtained from Eq. (A2.1.8),
The far field scattered pressure is obtained when this result is combined with the rigid-body
scattered pressure distribution, Eq. (A2.2.1). This can be expressed as a form function,
