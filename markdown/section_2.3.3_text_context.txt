Using a similar argument the SHIE for the interior problem can be derived:
In terms of integral operator notation the boundary integral equations on the surface S,
are given by,

2.3.2 Differentiated Surface Helmholtz' Integral Equation
The SHIE taken on the boundary surface may be differentiated with respect to the normal
at P to obtain the Differentiated surface Helmholtz' integral equation (DSHIE),
There is also a DSHIE for the interior problem and the differentiated integral equations can be
written in terms of integral operators,

2.3.3 Boundary Layer Formulations
It was stated in Section 2.2 that the result of the integral operators on a continuous function
defined on the surface S, was a solution of the acoustic wave equation. Further more with the
correct definition of the Green's function the solution satisfies the radiation condition. Conse-
quently it is possible to define the velocity potential in the exterior domain, E. in terms of a
single layer distribution, u,
By differentiating with respect to some normal vector, defined in the exterior domain, an ex-
pression for the dimensionless velocity field is obtained.
When the field point, P, is taken to the surface S, the boundary layer formulation for the
acoustic problem is defined by,
Eq. (2.3.15) can be solved to obtain the single layer density i, and then Eg. (2.3.13) can be
used to evaluate the exterior and surface velocity potentials.
In a similar way the exterior velocity potential can be defined in terms of a double layer
distribution, o,
The differentiated form is given by,
Since the Ne operator is continuous across the surface S, then Eq. (2.3.17) can be solved for
P ES and the surface velocity potential is defined by,
