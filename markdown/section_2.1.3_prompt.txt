Convert this individual section from a 1992 LaTeX academic thesis PDF to markdown format.

INDIVIDUAL SECTION INFORMATION:
- Chapter Context: CHAPTER 2. Acoustic Problem
- Section: 2.1.3 Neumann boundary condition
- Processing: Individual subsection (pages 27-27)
- Content Type: Complete subsection with logical boundaries

EXPECTED SECTION STRUCTURE:
2.1.3 Neumann boundary condition

CRITICAL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. **COMPLETE TEXT TRANSCRIPTION**: Read entire PDF content without missing any text
   - Include ALL sentences and paragraphs, especially transitional text between sections
   - Pay attention to continuation text that may appear before section headers
   - Do NOT skip connector sentences that provide context or bridge between topics
   - SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE: Any sentences that reference technical methods, formulations, or comparisons
   - Look for partial sentences or paragraphs that continue from the previous page

2. **INDIVIDUAL SECTION PROCESSING** (COMPLETE_SECTION):
   - This is a single subsection from a larger chapter
   - **CRITICAL HEADING LEVEL**: Use ### for the main section header
   - Start with: ### 2.1.3 Neumann boundary condition <a id="section-2-1-3"></a>
   - **PROCESSING SCOPE**: Process the complete section including ALL content from pages 27-27
   - Process complete logical flow from section introduction through conclusion
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage of all section content

3. **MATHEMATICAL FORMATTING**:
   - Inline equations: $variable$ (NOT \(variable\))
   - Display equations (unnumbered): $$equation$$ (NOT \[equation\])
   - Display equations (numbered): $$equation \tag{2.5.1}$$ or $$\begin{align*} equation \tag{2.5.1} \end{align*}$$
   - **CRITICAL**: ALL numbered equations MUST use \tag{} inside the $$ block
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER put equation numbers outside $$ like: $$equation$$ (2.5.1)
   - **CRITICAL**: Opening $$ must NOT have newline after it
   - **CRITICAL**: Closing $$ must NOT have newline before it

4. **FIGURE FORMATTING**: Use HTML picture element format for dual theme support:

<a id="figure-x-y"></a>

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y.png">
  <img alt="Figure X.Y. Caption text here." src="assets/figure-x-y.png">
</picture>
Figure X.Y. Caption text here.

**Requirements**: Anchor BEFORE picture element, both themes, full alt text, plain caption below

5. **ANCHOR GENERATION AND HEADING HIERARCHY**:
   - **Chapter headers (level 1)**: # Chapter Title <a id="chapter-X"></a>
   - **Main sections (level 1)**: ## 2.1 Section Title <a id="section-2-1"></a>
   - **Subsections (level 2)**: ### 2.1.1 Subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1"></a>
   - **Sub-subsections (level 3)**: #### 2.1.1.1 Sub-subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1-1"></a>
   - **CRITICAL**: Use correct heading depth based on section numbering depth
   - Figures: <a id="figure-2-1"></a> before figure elements
   - Equations: <a id="equation-2-1"></a> before equation blocks
   - Tables: <a id="table-2-1"></a> before table content

6. **CROSS-REFERENCES**:
   - Figures: [Figure 2.1](#figure-2-1), [Fig. 2.1](#figure-2-1)
   - Equations: [equation (2.1)](#equation-2-1), [Eq. (2.1)](#equation-2-1)
   - Tables: [Table 2.1](#table-2-1), [Tab. 2.1](#table-2-1)

7. **PDF TEXT GUIDANCE**: Use this extracted text to verify accuracy and completeness:

Acoustic Problem.
Since the fluid velocity and pressure are given by a linear differential equation, it is possible
to assume an harmonic time dependency of the form eur, where a is the circular frequency of
the pressure field. The time independent fluid variables are,
Substituting Eq. (2.1.9) into Eq. (2.1.8) results in the expression,
where the wave number k is w/c. This equation is linown as the reduced wave equation or
Helmholtz' equation
2.1.3 Neumann boundary condition
The reduced wave equation is solved in terms of the Neumann boundary condition which
relates the fluid velocity to the normal velocity prescribed on S. This boundary condition is
defined by,
where the subscript notation for the ambient density, p, is dropped and,
This boundary condition is sufficient for the solution of Helmholtz' equation for a finite
body of fluid. For unbounded fluid problems another boundary condition is needed to uniquely
specify the solution to Helmholtz' equation.
