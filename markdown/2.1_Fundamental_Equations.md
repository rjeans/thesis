## 2.1 Fundamental Equations <a id="section-2-1"></a>

The analysis of any acoustic problem involves the solution of a differential equation relating fluid variables in the medium of interest, subject to certain boundary conditions. This work is primarily concerned with the interaction of acoustic radiation with submerged structures and the appropriate differential equation is the linear wave equation subject to a velocity boundary condition on the submerged structure.
