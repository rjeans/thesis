Convert this individual section from a 1992 LaTeX academic thesis PDF to markdown format.

INDIVIDUAL SECTION INFORMATION:
- Chapter Context: CHAPTER 2. Acoustic Problem
- Section: 2.2.2 Discontinuities
- Processing: Individual subsection (pages 29-32)
- Content Type: Complete subsection with logical boundaries

EXPECTED SECTION STRUCTURE:
2.2.2 Discontinuities

CRITICAL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. **COMPLETE TEXT TRANSCRIPTION**: Read entire PDF content without missing any text
   - Include ALL sentences and paragraphs, especially transitional text between sections
   - Pay attention to continuation text that may appear before section headers
   - Do NOT skip connector sentences that provide context or bridge between topics
   - SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE: Any sentences that reference technical methods, formulations, or comparisons
   - Look for partial sentences or paragraphs that continue from the previous page

2. **INDIVIDUAL SECTION PROCESSING** (COMPLETE_SECTION):
   - This is a single subsection from a larger chapter
   - **CRITICAL HEADING LEVEL**: Use ### for the main section header
   - Start with: ### 2.2.2 Discontinuities <a id="section-2-2-2"></a>
   - **PROCESSING SCOPE**: Process the complete section including ALL content from pages 29-32
   - Process complete logical flow from section introduction through conclusion
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage of all section content

3. **MATHEMATICAL FORMATTING**:
   - Inline equations: $variable$ (NOT \(variable\))
   - Display equations (unnumbered): $$equation$$ (NOT \[equation\])
   - Display equations (numbered): $$equation \tag{2.5.1}$$ or $$\begin{align*} equation \tag{2.5.1} \end{align*}$$
   - **CRITICAL**: ALL numbered equations MUST use \tag{} inside the $$ block
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER put equation numbers outside $$ like: $$equation$$ (2.5.1)
   - **CRITICAL**: Opening $$ must NOT have newline after it
   - **CRITICAL**: Closing $$ must NOT have newline before it

4. **FIGURE FORMATTING**: Use HTML picture element format for dual theme support:

<a id="figure-x-y"></a>

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y.png">
  <img alt="Figure X.Y. Caption text here." src="assets/figure-x-y.png">
</picture>
Figure X.Y. Caption text here.

**Requirements**: Anchor BEFORE picture element, both themes, full alt text, plain caption below

5. **ANCHOR GENERATION AND HEADING HIERARCHY**:
   - **Chapter headers (level 1)**: # Chapter Title <a id="chapter-X"></a>
   - **Main sections (level 1)**: ## 2.1 Section Title <a id="section-2-1"></a>
   - **Subsections (level 2)**: ### 2.1.1 Subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1"></a>
   - **Sub-subsections (level 3)**: #### 2.1.1.1 Sub-subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1-1"></a>
   - **CRITICAL**: Use correct heading depth based on section numbering depth
   - Figures: <a id="figure-2-1"></a> before figure elements
   - Equations: <a id="equation-2-1"></a> before equation blocks
   - Tables: <a id="table-2-1"></a> before table content

6. **CROSS-REFERENCES**:
   - Figures: [Figure 2.1](#figure-2-1), [Fig. 2.1](#figure-2-1)
   - Equations: [equation (2.1)](#equation-2-1), [Eq. (2.1)](#equation-2-1)
   - Tables: [Table 2.1](#table-2-1), [Tab. 2.1](#table-2-1)
   - Sections: [Section 2.1](#section-2-1), [Sec. 2.1](#section-2-1)
   - References: [Author (Year)](#bib-author-year)

7. **PDF TEXT GUIDANCE**: Use this extracted text to verify accuracy and completeness:

Acoustic Problem.
to its derivatives; ie values at neighbouring points, but also to its values at the boundary. The
boundary conditions are built into an integral equation through the form of its ernel, but for
a differential equation the boundary conditions are imposed at the final stage of solution. This
kernel is the Green's function for the problem.
For the acoustic problem, the Green's function is the fundamental solution of the inhomo
geneous Helmholtz' equation.
where S(P, Q) is the delta-dirac function. Also the Green's function must satisfy Sommerfeld's
radiation condition, Eq. (1.1.13). The appropriate solution in three dimensions is given by,
In this equation r is the Euclidean distance between the field points P and Q.
2.2.2 Discontinuities
The integral operators that are of interest are defined by.
The function & is assumed to be a continuous function over S. For completeness there is also
the identity operator,
An important property of these operators defined in Eq. (2.2....
