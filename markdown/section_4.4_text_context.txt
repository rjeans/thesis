l'or the variational formulation, Eq. (2.5.6) is multiplied by S@(p) and integrated with
respect to p over the shell surface S,
The expression for the Ne operator given in Eq. (4.2.1) can be further transformed by
integrating by parts to obtain the expression,
Eq. (1.3.3) contains singularities of O(r-1) and consequently it is possible to integrate this
equation accurately using the modified integration scheme of Lachat and Watson [1976].
In arriving at Eq. (4.3.3) integrations around the edge of the thin shell are discarded. The
justification for this in Chapter 3 was that for closed thin shells there is no edge and consequently
these integrations must be equal to zero. For non-closed thin shells this is not the case. However
in Chapter 2 it was shown that the pressure difference around the edge of the shell must be
equal to zero. Therefore for these shells the edge integration must also be equal to zero.
4.4 Numerical Implementation
The discretization of the variational formulation is implemented using the same order of
interpolation as that for the collocation method. The Vi operator can be numerically approxi-

Variational Method.
In Eq. (4.4.1) the gradient of the shape function is expressed in terms of the local coordinate
axis system. In order to evaluate these gradients it is necessary to use the relationship shown
in Eq (3.2.11). The Jacobian matrix for the system, defined in Eq. (3.2.7), then enables the
gradient to be expressed in derivatives of the curvilinear system.
For the integration in Eq. (4.4.1), the point p ranges over S, and the point q ranges over Sj.
The integration with respect to p is performed using simple Gauss integration. The singularities
in the above numerical approximation will occur at these Gauss integration points when i = j.
It is these auto-influence elements that need to be integrated using the Lachat and Watson
singular integration scheme. For the integration with respect to q, the element, will be divided

The expression in Eq. (4.4.1) can be assembled into a matrix formulation of the variational
problem,
where the matrix (A] represents the numerical approximation,
In practice this banded symmetric matrix may be further approximated by the diagonal matrix,

The matrix equation in Eq. (4.4.2) is symmetric and is factorized into a LET form using
the standard Choleski factorization technique (Jennings [1977)). The pressure differences are
then evaluated by means of forward and backward substitution. The order of Gauss integration
used to calculate the numerical results in this chapter are summarized in Table (4.1). Chapter
2 showed that the pressure distribution exterior to the thin shell is given by,
and following similar arguments presented in Chapter 3 the far field pressure distribution is
approximated by the vector expression,

4.5 Uniqueness of the Numerical Formulation
The variational method was introduced as a way of formulating the acoustic problem for
thin shells. In general there is no problem of uniqueness of the numerical solution for thin
shells since the interior domain for the shell tends to zero. Since the density of interior resonant
frequencies is proportional to this volume, the numerical formulation for non closed thin shells
is unique for all frequencies.
For rigid thin shells that enclose a finite interior domain there will be problems of uniqueness
at the resonant frequencies of this interior domain. Since the variational formulation of the
