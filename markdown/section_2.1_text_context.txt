Acoustic Problem
2.1 Fundamental Equations
The analysis of any acoustic problem involves the solution of a differential equation relating
fluid variables in the medium of interest, subject to certain boundary conditions. This work is
primarily concerned with the interaction of acoustic radiation with submerged structures and
the appropriate differential equation is the linear wave equation subject to a velocity boundary
condition on the submerged structure.
2.1.1 Linear Approximation
In a fundamental analysis (Pierce (1989]) of the acoustic pressure field, the linear wave
equation is developed from a consideration of mass and energy conservation. This analysis
assumes that the acoustic pressure field is a sinall amplitude perturbation to the ambient state,
characterized by those values that pressure, density and fluid velocity have when the perturbation
is absent. The fluid or acoustic medium is assumed to be homogeneous and quiescent; ie the
ambient quantities are assumed to be independent of position and time with the ambient fluid
velocity equal to zero.
Consider a body of fluid in a volume V, with density p, surrounded by a surface S. The
fluid velocity at a point P is given by w(P) and the outward normal to the surface S is defined
by n. Conservation of mass requires that the net mass leaving V per unit time is equal to the
rate at which mass decreases in V. This is expressed by the relationship,
The right hand side of this equation can be transformed to a volume integral by means of Gauss'
theorem and Euler's differential equation for conservation of mass is obtained,
The pressure field at a point P is given by p(P). By considering the forces acting on the
fluid, and neglecting body forces and viscosity, the fluid velocity and pressure are related by,
