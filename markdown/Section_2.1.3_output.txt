### 2.1.3 Neumann boundary condition <a id="section-2-1-3"></a>

The reduced wave equation is solved in terms of the Neumann boundary condition which relates the fluid velocity to the normal velocity prescribed on $S$. This boundary condition is defined by,

$$\frac{\partial \hat{p}}{\partial n} = i \omega \rho \hat{v}_n, \tag{2.1.11}$$

where the subscript notation for the ambient density, $\rho$, is dropped and,

$$\frac{\partial \hat{p}}{\partial n} = \mathbf{n} \cdot \nabla \hat{p}, \quad \hat{v}_n = \mathbf{n} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{v}}. \tag{2.1.12}$$

This boundary condition is sufficient for the solution of Helmholtz' equation for a finite body of fluid. For unbounded fluid problems another boundary condition is needed to uniquely specify the solution to Helmholtz' equation.
