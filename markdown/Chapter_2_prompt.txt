Convert this individual section from a 1992 LaTeX academic thesis PDF to markdown format.

INDIVIDUAL SECTION INFORMATION:
- Context: Top-level chapter
- Section: 2 CHAPTER 2. Acoustic Problem
- Processing: individual chapter (pages 25-25)
- Content Type: Complete chapter with logical boundaries

EXPECTED SECTION STRUCTURE:
2 CHAPTER 2. Acoustic Problem (parent section content only)

CRITICAL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. **COMPLETE TEXT TRANSCRIPTION**: Read entire PDF content without missing any text
   - Include ALL sentences and paragraphs, especially transitional text between sections
   - Pay attention to continuation text that may appear before section headers
   - Do NOT skip connector sentences that provide context or bridge between topics
   - SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE: Any sentences that reference technical methods, formulations, or comparisons
   - Look for partial sentences or paragraphs that continue from the previous page

2. **INDIVIDUAL SECTION PROCESSING** (PARENT_SECTION_ONLY):
   - This is a complete chapter from a larger chapter
   - **CRITICAL HEADING LEVEL**: Use # for the main section header
   - Start with: # 2 CHAPTER 2. Acoustic Problem <a id="section-2"></a>
   - **PARENT SECTION CONTENT**: Extract only the main section heading (e.g., # APPENDIX 2 Analytical Solutions <a id="section-a2"></a>), and do not include any surrounding or subsequent paragraph text, unless it clearly precedes any subsection heading. If the very next content after the heading is a subsection (e.g., A2.1), then treat the parent section as heading only, with no body content.

3. **MATHEMATICAL FORMATTING**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Inline equations: $variable$ (NOT \(variable\))
   - **CRITICAL**: Display equations (unnumbered): $$equation$$ (NOT \[equation\])
   - **CRITICAL**: Display equations (numbered): $$equation \tag{2.5.1}$$ or $$\begin{align*} equation \tag{2.5.1} \end{align*}$$
   - **CRITICAL**: ALL numbered equations MUST use \tag{} inside the $$ block
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER put equation numbers outside $$ like: $$equation$$ (2.5.1)
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER use \(variable\) or \[equation\] - these are forbidden
   - **CRITICAL**: Complex superscripts/subscripts must use braces: $\lambda_N^{{e_p}}$ NOT $\lambda_N^e_p$
   - Use proper LaTeX notation for mathematical symbols and operators

**EXAMPLES:**
- Correct inline: The $N_i^k$ operator can be...
- Wrong inline: The \(N_i^k\) operator can be...
- Correct display: $$equation content \tag{4.4.1}$$
- Wrong display: \[equation content\]
- Correct complex subscript/superscript: $\lambda_N^{{e_p}}$
- Wrong complex subscript/superscript: $\lambda_N^e_p$

4. **FIGURE FORMATTING**: Use HTML picture element format with correct section-based naming:

<a id="figure-x-y"></a>

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y.png">
  <img alt="Figure X.Y. Caption text here." src="assets/figure-x-y.png">
</picture>
Figure X.Y. Caption text here.

**CRITICAL NAMING**: Use the actual section prefix in figure names:
- For Chapter 2: figure-2-1.png, figure-2-2.png
- For Appendix A2: figure-A2-1.png, figure-A2-2.png  
- For Appendix A1: figure-A1-1.png, figure-A1-2.png
**Requirements**: Anchor BEFORE picture element, both themes, full alt text, plain caption below

5. **TABLE FORMATTING**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Convert ALL tables to proper Markdown table format
   - **PRESERVE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE**: Maintain the exact layout and orientation from the PDF
   - Add anchor before table: `<a id="table-a2-1"></a>`
   - Use pipe-separated format with proper alignment:
     ```
     <a id="table-2-1"></a>
     
     | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
     |----------|----------|----------|
     | Value 1  | Value 2  | Value 3  |
     | Value 4  | Value 5  | Value 6  |
     
     **Table 2.1**: Caption text describing the table contents
     ```
   - **CRITICAL**: If the table has column headers (like n=0, n=1, n=2...), use them as column headers
   - **CRITICAL**: If the table has row labels, include them in the first column
   - Preserve all table data accurately, including numerical values and units
   - Maintain proper column alignment (left, center, right as appropriate)
   - Include complete table captions below the table
   - **DO NOT SKIP TABLES** - they contain important data that must be preserved
   - **DO NOT TRANSPOSE**: Keep rows as rows and columns as columns as shown in the original

6. **ANCHOR GENERATION AND HEADING HIERARCHY**:
   - **Chapter headers (level 1)**: # Chapter Title <a id="chapter-X"></a>
   - **Main sections (level 1)**: ## 2.1 Section Title <a id="section-2-1"></a>
   - **Subsections (level 2)**: ### 2.1.1 Subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1"></a>
   - **Sub-subsections (level 3)**: #### 2.1.1.1 Sub-subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1-1"></a>
   - **CRITICAL**: Use correct heading depth based on section numbering depth
   - Figures: <a id="figure-2-1"></a> before figure elements
   - Equations: <a id="equation-2-1"></a> before equation blocks
   - Tables: <a id="table-2-1"></a> before table content

7. **CROSS-REFERENCES**:
   - Figures: [Figure 2.1](#figure-2-1), [Fig. 2.1](#figure-2-1)
   - Equations: [equation (2.1)](#equation-2-1), [Eq. (2.1)](#equation-2-1)
   - Tables: [Table 2.1](#table-2-1), [Tab. 2.1](#table-2-1)
   - Sections: [Section 2.1](#section-2-1), [Sec. 2.1](#section-2-1)
   - **Literature References**: Convert ALL citation patterns to markdown links:
     * "Author [Year]" → [Author [Year]](#bib-author-year) e.g., [Jennings [1977]](#bib-jennings-1977)
     * "Author (Year)" → [Author (Year)](#bib-author-year) e.g., [Smith (1990)](#bib-smith-1990)
     * "Author et al. [Year]" → [Author et al. [Year]](#bib-author-et-al-year) e.g., [Jones et al. [1985]](#bib-jones-et-al-1985)
     * "Author and Author [Year]" → [Author and Author [Year]](#bib-author-author-year) e.g., [Burton and Miller [1971]](#bib-burton-miller-1971)

Acoustic Problem.
CHAPTER 2.
Acoustic Problem
2.1 Fundamental Equations
The analysis of any acoustic problem involves the solution of a differential equation relating
fluid variables in the medium of interest, subject to certain boundary conditions. This work is
primarily concerned with the interaction of acoustic radiation with submerged structures and
the appropriate differential equation is the linear wave equation subject to a velocity boundary
condition on the submerged structure.
2.1.1 Linear Approximation
In a fundamental analysis (Pierce (1989]) of the acoustic pressure field, the linear wave
equation is developed from a consideration of mass and energy conservation. This analysis
assumes that the acoustic pressure field is a sinall amplitude perturbation to the ambient state,
characterized by those values that pressure, density and fluid velocity have when the perturbation
is absent. The fluid or acoustic medium is assumed to be homogeneous and quiescent; ie the
ambient quantities are assumed to be independent of position and time with the ambient fluid
velocity equal to zero.
Consider a body of fluid in a volume V, with density p, surrounded by a surface S. The
fluid velocity at a point P is given by w(P) and the outward normal to the surface S is defined
by n. Conservation of mass requires that the net mass leaving V per unit time is equal to the
rate at which mass decreases in V. This is expressed by the relationship,
The right hand side of this equation can be transformed to a volume integral by means of Gauss'
theorem and Euler's differential equation for conservation of mass is obtained,
The pressure field at a point P is given by p(P). By considering the forces acting on the
fluid, and neglecting body forces and viscosity, the fluid velocity and pressure are related by,
