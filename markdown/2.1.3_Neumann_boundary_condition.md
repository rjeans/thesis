### 2.1.3 Neumann boundary condition <a id="section-2-1-3"></a>

The reduced wave equation is solved in terms of the Neumann boundary condition which relates the fluid velocity to the normal velocity prescribed on $S$. This boundary condition is defined by,

$$
\frac{\partial \dot{p}}{\partial n} = i \omega \rho \dot{v}_n, \tag{2.1.11}
$$

where the subscript notation for the ambient density, $\rho$, is dropped and,

$$
\frac{\partial \dot{p}}{\partial n} = \mathbf{n} \cdot \nabla \dot{p}, \quad \dot{v}_n = \mathbf{n} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{v}}. \tag{2.1.12}
$$

This boundary condition is sufficient for the solution of Helmholtz' equation for a finite body of fluid. For unbounded fluid problems, another boundary condition is needed to uniquely specify the solution to Helmholtz' equation.
