to its derivatives; ie values at neighbouring points, but also to its values at the boundary. The
boundary conditions are built into an integral equation through the form of its ernel, but for
a differential equation the boundary conditions are imposed at the final stage of solution. This
kernel is the Green's function for the problem.
For the acoustic problem, the Green's function is the fundamental solution of the inhomo
geneous Helmholtz' equation.
where S(P, Q) is the delta-dirac function. Also the Green's function must satisfy Sommerfeld's
radiation condition, Eq. (1.1.13). The appropriate solution in three dimensions is given by,
In this equation r is the Euclidean distance between the field points P and Q.
2.2.2 Discontinuities
The integral operators that are of interest are defined by.
The function & is assumed to be a continuous function over S. For completeness there is also
the identity operator,
An important property of these operators defined in Eq. (2.2.3-6) is that they are all solutions of
the original acoustic differential equation. Each can be thought of as the result of a continuous
distribution of sources, magnitude d(Q), over the surface of S.

It is useful to establish the behaviour of these integral operators as the field point P is
brought to the surface S. The limit of a field point brought to the surface in the direction
opposite to the direction of the surface normal will be denoted by pt, the limit of the field point
brought to the surface in the same direction as the surface normal will be denoted by p. In
general points on a surface will be denoted by lower case symbols. Firstly construct a small
sphere of small radius & centered around the surface limit point. The domain of integration is
taken to be the surface S, excluding the small sphere, and that part of the small sphere, Se,
that completes the surface. The radius e is then taken to zero to evaluate the limiting value of
the integral operator. Figure (2.1) illustrates the geometry for evaluating the limit of P - pt.
Consider the integral operator Ck.
The polar angles 0 and & define the surface Se. For Eq. (2.2.8) the second term on the right
hand side goes to zero in the limit and so the operator Lk is continuous across the surface S.
Consider the same limiting process for the My operator,
In Eq. (2.2.9) the vector i is the unit vector pointing from P to pt. This time the second term
on the right hand side tends towards a limiting value and so,
The quantity Anc(p) is the external solid angle at the point p. For a smooth surface; ie one that
has a unique tangent plane, then
A definition of c(p) can be gained by considering the limit,

This equation is continuous as P passes through the surface S. Noting the discontinuity in the
Mk operator, indicates a mathematical definition for the quantity c(p),
Using the arguments described above, it is possible to evaluate the discontinuity properties
of all the integral equations and these are summarized below,
It is important to realize that Ma(Ф](p*) represents the limiting value of Ma(Ф](P) as P
tends to pt, whilst Mk(Q](p) represents the principal value of the integral operation; that is the
limit value of an integration over a surface S - Se, as e goes to zero.
2.3 Helmholtz' Integral Equations
2.3.1 Surface Helmholtz Integral Equation
The Surface Helmholtz' Integral equation (SHIE) forms the basis of most boundary element
methods (BEM). This equation can be derived by considering the general acoustic geometry
shown in figure (2.2). A spherical surface, Se contains two closed surface Si and S. The surface
S represents the acoustic surface of interest and the surface Si represents the surface of some
acoustic source. The domain E is the volume contained by So excluding the volume contained
by Si and S. The domain D represents the volume contained by the surface S. A small spherical
surface Se surrounds the field point P.
With the surface Se excluding the singular point P from the domain E, both the Green's
free space function and the velocity potential in E satisfy the reduced wave equation and so,
