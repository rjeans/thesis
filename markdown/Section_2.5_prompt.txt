Convert this individual section from a 1992 LaTeX academic thesis PDF to markdown format.

INDIVIDUAL SECTION INFORMATION:
- Context: CHAPTER 2. Acoustic Problem
- Section: 2.5 Thin shell formulation
- Processing: individual main section (pages 39-39)
- Content Type: Complete main section with logical boundaries

EXPECTED SECTION STRUCTURE:
2.5 Thin shell formulation (parent section content only)

CRITICAL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. **COMPLETE TEXT TRANSCRIPTION**: Read entire PDF content without missing any text
   - Include ALL sentences and paragraphs, especially transitional text between sections
   - Pay attention to continuation text that may appear before section headers
   - Do NOT skip connector sentences that provide context or bridge between topics
   - SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE: Any sentences that reference technical methods, formulations, or comparisons
   - Look for partial sentences or paragraphs that continue from the previous page

2. **INDIVIDUAL SECTION PROCESSING** (PARENT_SECTION_ONLY):
   - This is a complete main section from a larger chapter
   - **CRITICAL HEADING LEVEL**: Use ## for the main section header
   - Start with: ## 2.5 Thin shell formulation <a id="section-2-5"></a>
   - **PARENT SECTION CONTENT**: Extract only the main section heading (e.g., # APPENDIX 2 Analytical Solutions <a id="section-a2"></a>), and do not include any surrounding or subsequent paragraph text, unless it clearly precedes any subsection heading. If the very next content after the heading is a subsection (e.g., A2.1), then treat the parent section as heading only, with no body content.

3. **MATHEMATICAL FORMATTING**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Inline equations: $variable$ (NOT \(variable\))
   - **CRITICAL**: Display equations (unnumbered): $$equation$$ (NOT \[equation\])
   - **CRITICAL**: Display equations (numbered): $$equation \tag{2.5.1}$$ or $$\begin{align*} equation \tag{2.5.1} \end{align*}$$
   - **CRITICAL**: ALL numbered equations MUST use \tag{} inside the $$ block
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER put equation numbers outside $$ like: $$equation$$ (2.5.1)
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER use \(variable\) or \[equation\] - these are forbidden
   - **CRITICAL**: Complex superscripts/subscripts must use braces: $\lambda_N^{{e_p}}$ NOT $\lambda_N^e_p$
   - Use proper LaTeX notation for mathematical symbols and operators

**EXAMPLES:**
- Correct inline: The $N_i^k$ operator can be...
- Wrong inline: The \(N_i^k\) operator can be...
- Correct display: $$equation content \tag{4.4.1}$$
- Wrong display: \[equation content\]
- Correct complex subscript/superscript: $\lambda_N^{{e_p}}$
- Wrong complex subscript/superscript: $\lambda_N^e_p$

4. **FIGURE FORMATTING**: Use HTML picture element format with correct section-based naming:

<a id="figure-x-y"></a>

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y.png">
  <img alt="Figure X.Y. Caption text here." src="assets/figure-x-y.png">
</picture>
Figure X.Y. Caption text here.

**CRITICAL NAMING**: Use the actual section prefix in figure names:
- For Chapter 2: figure-2-1.png, figure-2-2.png
- For Appendix A2: figure-A2-1.png, figure-A2-2.png  
- For Appendix A1: figure-A1-1.png, figure-A1-2.png
**Requirements**: Anchor BEFORE picture element, both themes, full alt text, plain caption below

5. **TABLE FORMATTING**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Convert ALL tables to proper Markdown table format
   - **PRESERVE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE**: Maintain the exact layout and orientation from the PDF
   - Add anchor before table: `<a id="table-a2-1"></a>`
   - Use pipe-separated format with proper alignment:
     ```
     <a id="table-2-1"></a>
     
     | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
     |----------|----------|----------|
     | Value 1  | Value 2  | Value 3  |
     | Value 4  | Value 5  | Value 6  |
     
     **Table 2.1**: Caption text describing the table contents
     ```
   - **CRITICAL**: If the table has column headers (like n=0, n=1, n=2...), use them as column headers
   - **CRITICAL**: If the table has row labels, include them in the first column
   - Preserve all table data accurately, including numerical values and units
   - Maintain proper column alignment (left, center, right as appropriate)
   - Include complete table captions below the table
   - **DO NOT SKIP TABLES** - they contain important data that must be preserved
   - **DO NOT TRANSPOSE**: Keep rows as rows and columns as columns as shown in the original

6. **ANCHOR GENERATION AND HEADING HIERARCHY**:
   - **Chapter headers (level 1)**: # Chapter Title <a id="chapter-X"></a>
   - **Main sections (level 1)**: ## 2.1 Section Title <a id="section-2-1"></a>
   - **Subsections (level 2)**: ### 2.1.1 Subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1"></a>
   - **Sub-subsections (level 3)**: #### 2.1.1.1 Sub-subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1-1"></a>
   - **CRITICAL**: Use correct heading depth based on section numbering depth
   - Figures: <a id="figure-2-1"></a> before figure elements
   - Equations: <a id="equation-2-1"></a> before equation blocks
   - Tables: <a id="table-2-1"></a> before table content

7. **CROSS-REFERENCES**:
   - Figures: [Figure 2.1](#figure-2-1), [Fig. 2.1](#figure-2-1)
   - Equations: [equation (2.1)](#equation-2-1), [Eq. (2.1)](#equation-2-1)
   - Tables: [Table 2.1](#table-2-1), [Tab. 2.1](#table-2-1)
   - Sections: [Section 2.1](#section-2-1), [Sec. 2.1](#section-2-1)
   - **Literature References**: Convert ALL citation patterns to markdown links:
     * "Author [Year]" → [Author [Year]](#bib-author-year) e.g., [Jennings [1977]](#bib-jennings-1977)
     * "Author (Year)" → [Author (Year)](#bib-author-year) e.g., [Smith (1990)](#bib-smith-1990)
     * "Author et al. [Year]" → [Author et al. [Year]](#bib-author-et-al-year) e.g., [Jones et al. [1985]](#bib-jones-et-al-1985)
     * "Author and Author [Year]" → [Author and Author [Year]](#bib-author-author-year) e.g., [Burton and Miller [1971]](#bib-burton-miller-1971)

8. **PDF TEXT GUIDANCE**: Use this extracted text to verify accuracy and completeness:

Acoustic Problem.
2.4.4 Boundary layer formulations
The boundary layer formulations for the exterior acoustic problem also exhibit similar non-
uniqueness properties at the critical wavenumbers described above. A similar argument to show
this non-uniqueness to that for the SHIE and DSHIE can be used. However another argument
is illustrated in figures (2.3) and (2.4). These arguments use the jump properties of the integral
operators derived in section (1.2.2),
Single layer:
Double layer:
The single layer formulation proves to be non-unique at eigenvalues of the interior Dirichlet
problem and the double layer formulation proves to be non-unique at eigenvalues of the interior
Neumann problem.
2.4.5 Hybrid boundary layer formulation
The established technique for overcoming the problem of uniqueness in a boundary layer
formulation is to express the surface velocity potential in terms of a hybrid combination of a
single and double layer surface distribution. The exterior velocity potential is defined by,
Consequently the boundary integral equations defining the acoustic problem are,
If the coupling constant, a is constrained to be imaginary, then the numerical solution of
this hybrid formulation is unique at all frequencies. Again the disadvantage of this formulation
is that it requires the integration of the hypersingular kernel in the Ne operator.
