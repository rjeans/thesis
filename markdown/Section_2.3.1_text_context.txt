Acoustic Problem.
This equation is continuous as P passes through the surface S. Noting the discontinuity in the
Mk operator, indicates a mathematical definition for the quantity c(p),
Using the arguments described above, it is possible to evaluate the discontinuity properties
of all the integral equations and these are summarized below,
It is important to realize that Ma(Ф](p*) represents the limiting value of Ma(Ф](P) as P
tends to pt, whilst Mk(Q](p) represents the principal value of the integral operation; that is the
limit value of an integration over a surface S - Se, as e goes to zero.
2.3 Helmholtz' Integral Equations
2.3.1 Surface Helmholtz Integral Equation
The Surface Helmholtz' Integral equation (SHIE) forms the basis of most boundary element
methods (BEM). This equation can be derived by considering the general acoustic geometry
shown in figure (2.2). A spherical surface, Se contains two closed surface Si and S. The surface
S represents the acoustic surface of interest and the surface Si represents the surface of some
acoustic source. The domain E is the volume contained by So excluding the volume contained
by Si and S. The domain D represents the volume contained by the surface S. A small spherical
surface Se surrounds the field point P.
With the surface Se excluding the singular point P from the domain E, both the Green's
free space function and the velocity potential in E satisfy the reduced wave equation and so,

By using Green's formula this volume integral may by converted to a combination of surface
integrals over the surfaces bounding E,
where the integrals I(P) are of the form,
The negative sign reflects the fact that the normals are defined to point into the domain E.
The SHIE for an infinite exterior domain is obtained when the radius of the surface Se is
taken to infinity and the radius of Se is taken to zero. By the Sommerfeld radiation condition
Iss will tend to zero. The integral Is, has different values depending on the position of the field
point P. For P in D its value must be zero since Is, is no longer a bounding surface of E. For
P on S or in E its value can be evaluated in a similar way to the limiting procedures of section
(1.2.2). The value of this integral as in the limit is given by,
The integral Is, may now be seen to be equivalent to the velocity potential that would exist
in the absence of the surface S,
The SHIE for the infinite exterior domain can now be written as,

2.3.2 Differentiated Surface Helmholtz' Integral Equation
The SHIE taken on the boundary surface may be differentiated with respect to the normal
at P to obtain the Differentiated surface Helmholtz' integral equation (DSHIE),
There is also a DSHIE for the interior problem and the differentiated integral equations can be
written in terms of integral operators,
