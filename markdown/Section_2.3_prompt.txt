Convert this individual section from a 1992 LaTeX academic thesis PDF to markdown format.

INDIVIDUAL SECTION INFORMATION:
- Context: CHAPTER 2. Acoustic Problem
- Section: 2.3 Helmholtz’ Integral Equations
- Processing: individual main section (pages 32-32)
- Content Type: Complete main section with logical boundaries

EXPECTED SECTION STRUCTURE:
2.3 Helmholtz’ Integral Equations (parent section content only)

CRITICAL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. **COMPLETE TEXT TRANSCRIPTION**: Read entire PDF content without missing any text
   - Include ALL sentences and paragraphs, especially transitional text between sections
   - Pay attention to continuation text that may appear before section headers
   - Do NOT skip connector sentences that provide context or bridge between topics
   - SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE: Any sentences that reference technical methods, formulations, or comparisons
   - Look for partial sentences or paragraphs that continue from the previous page

2. **INDIVIDUAL SECTION PROCESSING** (PARENT_SECTION_ONLY):
   - This is a complete main section from a larger chapter
   - **CRITICAL HEADING LEVEL**: Use ## for the main section header
   - Start with: ## 2.3 Helmholtz’ Integral Equations <a id="section-2-3"></a>
   - **PARENT SECTION CONTENT**: Extract only the main section heading (e.g., # APPENDIX 2 Analytical Solutions <a id="section-a2"></a>), and do not include any surrounding or subsequent paragraph text, unless it clearly precedes any subsection heading. If the very next content after the heading is a subsection (e.g., A2.1), then treat the parent section as heading only, with no body content.

3. **MATHEMATICAL FORMATTING**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Inline equations: $variable$ (NOT \(variable\))
   - **CRITICAL**: Display equations (unnumbered): $$equation$$ (NOT \[equation\])
   - **CRITICAL**: Display equations (numbered): $$equation \tag{2.5.1}$$ or $$\begin{align*} equation \tag{2.5.1} \end{align*}$$
   - **CRITICAL**: ALL numbered equations MUST use \tag{} inside the $$ block
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER put equation numbers outside $$ like: $$equation$$ (2.5.1)
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER use \(variable\) or \[equation\] - these are forbidden
   - **CRITICAL**: Complex superscripts/subscripts must use braces: $\lambda_N^{{e_p}}$ NOT $\lambda_N^e_p$
   - Use proper LaTeX notation for mathematical symbols and operators

**EXAMPLES:**
- Correct inline: The $N_i^k$ operator can be...
- Wrong inline: The \(N_i^k\) operator can be...
- Correct display: $$equation content \tag{4.4.1}$$
- Wrong display: \[equation content\]
- Correct complex subscript/superscript: $\lambda_N^{{e_p}}$
- Wrong complex subscript/superscript: $\lambda_N^e_p$

4. **FIGURE FORMATTING**: Use HTML picture element format with correct section-based naming:

<a id="figure-x-y"></a>

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y.png">
  <img alt="Figure X.Y. Caption text here." src="assets/figure-x-y.png">
</picture>
Figure X.Y. Caption text here.

**CRITICAL NAMING**: Use the actual section prefix in figure names:
- For Chapter 2: figure-2-1.png, figure-2-2.png
- For Appendix A2: figure-A2-1.png, figure-A2-2.png  
- For Appendix A1: figure-A1-1.png, figure-A1-2.png
**Requirements**: Anchor BEFORE picture element, both themes, full alt text, plain caption below

5. **TABLE FORMATTING**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Convert ALL tables to proper Markdown table format
   - **PRESERVE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE**: Maintain the exact layout and orientation from the PDF
   - Add anchor before table: `<a id="table-a2-1"></a>`
   - Use pipe-separated format with proper alignment:
     ```
     <a id="table-2-1"></a>
     
     | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
     |----------|----------|----------|
     | Value 1  | Value 2  | Value 3  |
     | Value 4  | Value 5  | Value 6  |
     
     **Table 2.1**: Caption text describing the table contents
     ```
   - **CRITICAL**: If the table has column headers (like n=0, n=1, n=2...), use them as column headers
   - **CRITICAL**: If the table has row labels, include them in the first column
   - Preserve all table data accurately, including numerical values and units
   - Maintain proper column alignment (left, center, right as appropriate)
   - Include complete table captions below the table
   - **DO NOT SKIP TABLES** - they contain important data that must be preserved
   - **DO NOT TRANSPOSE**: Keep rows as rows and columns as columns as shown in the original

6. **ANCHOR GENERATION AND HEADING HIERARCHY**:
   - **Chapter headers (level 1)**: # Chapter Title <a id="chapter-X"></a>
   - **Main sections (level 1)**: ## 2.1 Section Title <a id="section-2-1"></a>
   - **Subsections (level 2)**: ### 2.1.1 Subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1"></a>
   - **Sub-subsections (level 3)**: #### 2.1.1.1 Sub-subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1-1"></a>
   - **CRITICAL**: Use correct heading depth based on section numbering depth
   - Figures: <a id="figure-2-1"></a> before figure elements
   - Equations: <a id="equation-2-1"></a> before equation blocks
   - Tables: <a id="table-2-1"></a> before table content

7. **CROSS-REFERENCES**:
   - Figures: [Figure 2.1](#figure-2-1), [Fig. 2.1](#figure-2-1)
   - Equations: [equation (2.1)](#equation-2-1), [Eq. (2.1)](#equation-2-1)
   - Tables: [Table 2.1](#table-2-1), [Tab. 2.1](#table-2-1)
   - Sections: [Section 2.1](#section-2-1), [Sec. 2.1](#section-2-1)
   - **Literature References**: Convert ALL citation patterns to markdown links:
     * "Author [Year]" → [Author [Year]](#bib-author-year) e.g., [Jennings [1977]](#bib-jennings-1977)
     * "Author (Year)" → [Author (Year)](#bib-author-year) e.g., [Smith (1990)](#bib-smith-1990)
     * "Author et al. [Year]" → [Author et al. [Year]](#bib-author-et-al-year) e.g., [Jones et al. [1985]](#bib-jones-et-al-1985)
     * "Author and Author [Year]" → [Author and Author [Year]](#bib-author-author-year) e.g., [Burton and Miller [1971]](#bib-burton-miller-1971)

8. **PDF TEXT GUIDANCE**: Use this extracted text to verify accuracy and completeness:

Acoustic Problem.
This equation is continuous as P passes through the surface S. Noting the discontinuity in the
Mk operator, indicates a mathematical definition for the quantity c(p),
Using the arguments described above, it is possible to evaluate the discontinuity properties
of all the integral equations and these are summarized below,
It is important to realize that Ma(Ф](p*) represents the limiting value of Ma(Ф](P) as P
tends to pt, whilst Mk(Q](p) represents the principal value of the integral operation; that is the
limit value of an integration over a surface S - Se, as e goes to zero.
2.3 Helmholtz' Integral Equations
2.3.1 Surface Helmholtz Integral Equation
The Surface Helmholtz' Integral equation (SHIE) forms the basis of most boundary element
methods (BEM). This equation can be derived by considering the general acoustic geometry
shown in figure (2.2). A spherical surface, Se contains two closed surface Si and S. The surface
S represents the acoustic surface of interest and the surface Si represents the surface of some
acoustic source. The domain E is the volume contained by So excluding the volume contained
by Si and S. The domain D represents the volume contained by the surface S. A small spherical
surface Se surrounds the field point P.
With the surface Se excluding the singular point P from the domain E, both the Green's
free space function and the velocity potential in E satisfy the reduced wave equation and so,
