Convert this individual section from a 1992 LaTeX academic thesis PDF to markdown format.

INDIVIDUAL SECTION INFORMATION:
- Context: CHAPTER 2. Acoustic Problem
- Section: 2.1.3 Neumann boundary condition
- Processing: individual subsection (pages 27-27)
- Content Type: Complete subsection with logical boundaries

EXPECTED SECTION STRUCTURE:
2.1.3 Neumann boundary condition

CRITICAL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. **COMPLETE TEXT TRANSCRIPTION**: Read entire PDF content without missing any text
   - Include ALL sentences and paragraphs, especially transitional text between sections
   - Pay attention to continuation text that may appear before section headers
   - Do NOT skip connector sentences that provide context or bridge between topics
   - SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE: Any sentences that reference technical methods, formulations, or comparisons
   - Look for partial sentences or paragraphs that continue from the previous page

2. **INDIVIDUAL SECTION PROCESSING** (COMPLETE_SECTION):
   - This is a complete subsection from a larger chapter
   - **CRITICAL HEADING LEVEL**: Use ### for the main section header
   - Start with: ### 2.1.3 Neumann boundary condition <a id="section-2-1-3"></a>
   - Process the complete section content

3. **MATHEMATICAL FORMATTING**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Inline equations: $variable$ (NOT \(variable\))
   - **CRITICAL**: Display equations (unnumbered): $$equation$$ (NOT \[equation\])
   - **CRITICAL**: Display equations (numbered): $$equation \tag{2.5.1}$$ or $$\begin{align*} equation \tag{2.5.1} \end{align*}$$
   - **CRITICAL**: ALL numbered equations MUST use \tag{} inside the $$ block
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER put equation numbers outside $$ like: $$equation$$ (2.5.1)
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER use \(variable\) or \[equation\] - these are forbidden
   - **CRITICAL**: Complex superscripts/subscripts must use braces: $\lambda_N^{{e_p}}$ NOT $\lambda_N^e_p$
   - Use proper LaTeX notation for mathematical symbols and operators

**EXAMPLES:**
- Correct inline: The $N_i^k$ operator can be...
- Wrong inline: The \(N_i^k\) operator can be...
- Correct display: $$equation content \tag{4.4.1}$$
- Wrong display: \[equation content\]
- Correct complex subscript/superscript: $\lambda_N^{{e_p}}$
- Wrong complex subscript/superscript: $\lambda_N^e_p$

4. **FIGURE FORMATTING**: Use HTML picture element format with correct section-based naming:

<a id="figure-x-y"></a>

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y.png">
  <img alt="Figure X.Y. Caption text here." src="assets/figure-x-y.png">
</picture>
Figure X.Y. Caption text here.

**CRITICAL NAMING**: Use the actual section prefix in figure names:
- For Chapter 2: figure-2-1.png, figure-2-2.png
- For Appendix A2: figure-A2-1.png, figure-A2-2.png  
- For Appendix A1: figure-A1-1.png, figure-A1-2.png
**Requirements**: Anchor BEFORE picture element, both themes, full alt text, plain caption below

5. **TABLE FORMATTING**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Convert ALL tables to proper Markdown table format
   - **PRESERVE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE**: Maintain the exact layout and orientation from the PDF
   - Add anchor before table: `<a id="table-a2-1"></a>`
   - Use pipe-separated format with proper alignment:
     ```
     <a id="table-2-1"></a>
     
     | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
     |----------|----------|----------|
     | Value 1  | Value 2  | Value 3  |
     | Value 4  | Value 5  | Value 6  |
     
     **Table 2.1**: Caption text describing the table contents
     ```
   - **CRITICAL**: If the table has column headers (like n=0, n=1, n=2...), use them as column headers
   - **CRITICAL**: If the table has row labels, include them in the first column
   - Preserve all table data accurately, including numerical values and units
   - Maintain proper column alignment (left, center, right as appropriate)
   - Include complete table captions below the table
   - **DO NOT SKIP TABLES** - they contain important data that must be preserved
   - **DO NOT TRANSPOSE**: Keep rows as rows and columns as columns as shown in the original

6. **ANCHOR GENERATION AND HEADING HIERARCHY**:
   - **Chapter headers (level 1)**: # Chapter Title <a id="chapter-X"></a>
   - **Main sections (level 1)**: ## 2.1 Section Title <a id="section-2-1"></a>
   - **Subsections (level 2)**: ### 2.1.1 Subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1"></a>
   - **Sub-subsections (level 3)**: #### 2.1.1.1 Sub-subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1-1"></a>
   - **CRITICAL**: Use correct heading depth based on section numbering depth
   - Figures: <a id="figure-2-1"></a> before figure elements
   - Equations: <a id="equation-2-1"></a> before equation blocks
   - Tables: <a id="table-2-1"></a> before table content

7. **CROSS-REFERENCES**:
   - Figures: [Figure 2.1](#figure-2-1), [Fig. 2.1](#figure-2-1)
   - Equations: [equation (2.1)](#equation-2-1), [Eq. (2.1)](#equation-2-1)
   - Tables: [Table 2.1](#table-2-1), [Tab. 2.1](#table-2-1)
   - Sections: [Section 2.1](#section-2-1), [Sec. 2.1](#section-2-1)
   - **Literature References**: Convert ALL citation patterns to markdown links:
     * "Author [Year]" → [Author [Year]](#bib-author-year) e.g., [Jennings [1977]](#bib-jennings-1977)
     * "Author (Year)" → [Author (Year)](#bib-author-year) e.g., [Smith (1990)](#bib-smith-1990)
     * "Author et al. [Year]" → [Author et al. [Year]](#bib-author-et-al-year) e.g., [Jones et al. [1985]](#bib-jones-et-al-1985)
     * "Author and Author [Year]" → [Author and Author [Year]](#bib-author-author-year) e.g., [Burton and Miller [1971]](#bib-burton-miller-1971)

Acoustic Problem.
Since the fluid velocity and pressure are given by a linear differential equation, it is possible
to assume an harmonic time dependency of the form eur, where a is the circular frequency of
the pressure field. The time independent fluid variables are,
Substituting Eq. (2.1.9) into Eq. (2.1.8) results in the expression,
where the wave number k is w/c. This equation is linown as the reduced wave equation or
Helmholtz' equation
2.1.3 Neumann boundary condition
The reduced wave equation is solved in terms of the Neumann boundary condition which
relates the fluid velocity to the normal velocity prescribed on S. This boundary condition is
defined by,
where the subscript notation for the ambient density, p, is dropped and,
This boundary condition is sufficient for the solution of Helmholtz' equation for a finite
body of fluid. For unbounded fluid problems another boundary condition is needed to uniquely
specify the solution to Helmholtz' equation.
2.1.4 Sommerfeld's radiation condition
For unbounded acoustic problems the pressure field must obey some boundary condition
in the far field. This boundary condition is given by Sommerfeld's radiation condition. This is
defined by,

9. **SECTION PROCESSING GUIDELINES**:
   - Focus on this specific section's content only
   - Ensure the heading level matches the section numbering depth
   - Include complete mathematical derivations with explanatory context
   - Maintain academic writing conventions and technical precision
   - Preserve figure and table references within section context
   - **SECTION-AWARE NAMING**: Use the correct section prefix for figures and tables:
     * For Appendix A2: figure-A2-1.png, table-A2-1, etc.
     * For Chapter 2: figure-2-1.png, table-2-1, etc.
   - **HEADING FORMAT**: Include section numbers in subsection headings:
     * Top-level: "# APPENDIX 2 Analytical Solutions" (no A2 prefix)
     * Subsections: "## A2.1 Rigid Sphere", "## A2.2 Asymptotic Solutions" (include A2.1, A2.2 prefix)
   - **FOR PARENT SECTIONS ONLY**: Include introductory text that applies to the whole section, but stop before subsection headings or equations/content tagged with subsection numbers (e.g., stop before equations tagged A2.1.1, A2.1.2, or headings like "A2.1 Rigid Sphere")

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS**:
- Provide clean markdown without code block markers
- Focus on creating complete, coherent content
- Skip page headers, footers, or page numbers
