### 2.1.2 Wave Equation <a id="section-2-1-2"></a>

The wave equation results when $v'$ is eliminated from Eq. (2.1.6) and Eq. (2.1.7). From now on the prime notation will be neglected when indicating ambient state perturbations. The wave equation is given by,

$$\nabla^2 p - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = 0. \tag{2.1.8}$$

Since the fluid velocity and pressure are given by a linear differential equation, it is possible to assume a harmonic time dependency of the form $e^{-i\omega t}$, where $\omega$ is the circular frequency of the pressure field. The time independent fluid variables are,

$$p = \tilde{p} e^{-i\omega t}, \quad v = \tilde{v} e^{-i\omega t}. \tag{2.1.9}$$

Substituting Eq. (2.1.9) into Eq. (2.1.8) results in the expression,

$$\nabla^2 \tilde{p} + k^2 \tilde{p} = 0, \tag{2.1.10}$$

where the wave number $k$ is $\omega/c$. This equation is known as the reduced wave equation or Helmholtz' equation.
