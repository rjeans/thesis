Acoustic Problem.
The consequence of this condition is that it allows outward travelling waves to be the only valid
physical solution for a radiated or scattered wave from a surface.
Eq. (2.1.10), Eq. (2.1.11) and Eq (2.1.13) uniquely define the acoustic problem. For
some simple geometries it is possible to solve the acoustic problem analytically, however for the
majority of realistic problems a numerical solution technique is needed. Analytical solutions for
certain problems are useful in establishing the accuracy of various numerical strategies used to
solve the acoustic problem.
At this stage the concept of a velocity potential function will be defined. This function
enables the fluid velocity and pressure fields to be evaluated from one potential function. The
function is defined by,
with,
2.2 Integral Operators
This work is concerned with various methods of numerical solution by means of boundary
element methods. Later in this chapter the appropriate integral equations will be derived that
form the basis of any BEM. The integral operators that will combine to give an integral for-
mulation of the acoustic problem are introduced in this section and a brief discussion of their
numerical properties is presented in isolation from the physical problem.
2.2.1 Green's Function
In general when a differential equation is transformed into an integral equation, the form of
the integral equation not only depends on the governing differential equation, but the boundary
conditions specific to the problem. An integral equation not only relates an unknown function
