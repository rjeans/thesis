Convert this individual section from a 1992 LaTeX academic thesis PDF to markdown format.

INDIVIDUAL SECTION INFORMATION:
- Chapter Context: CHAPTER 2. Acoustic Problem
- Section: 2.3.2 Differentiated Surface Helmholtz’ Integral Equation
- Processing: Individual subsection (pages 35-35)
- Content Type: Complete subsection with logical boundaries

EXPECTED SECTION STRUCTURE:
2.3.2 Differentiated Surface Helmholtz’ Integral Equation

CRITICAL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. **COMPLETE TEXT TRANSCRIPTION**: Read entire PDF content without missing any text
   - Include ALL sentences and paragraphs, especially transitional text between sections
   - Pay attention to continuation text that may appear before section headers
   - Do NOT skip connector sentences that provide context or bridge between topics
   - SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE: Any sentences that reference technical methods, formulations, or comparisons
   - Look for partial sentences or paragraphs that continue from the previous page

2. **INDIVIDUAL SECTION PROCESSING** (COMPLETE_SECTION):
   - This is a single subsection from a larger chapter
   - **CRITICAL HEADING LEVEL**: Use ### for the main section header
   - Start with: ### 2.3.2 Differentiated Surface Helmholtz’ Integral Equation <a id="section-2-3-2"></a>
   - **PROCESSING SCOPE**: Process the complete section including ALL content from pages 35-35
   - Process complete logical flow from section introduction through conclusion
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage of all section content

3. **MATHEMATICAL FORMATTING**:
   - Inline equations: $variable$ (NOT \(variable\))
   - Display equations (unnumbered): $$equation$$ (NOT \[equation\])
   - Display equations (numbered): $$equation \tag{2.5.1}$$ or $$\begin{align*} equation \tag{2.5.1} \end{align*}$$
   - **CRITICAL**: ALL numbered equations MUST use \tag{} inside the $$ block
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER put equation numbers outside $$ like: $$equation$$ (2.5.1)
   - **CRITICAL**: Opening $$ must NOT have newline after it
   - **CRITICAL**: Closing $$ must NOT have newline before it

4. **FIGURE FORMATTING**: Use HTML picture element format for dual theme support:

<a id="figure-x-y"></a>

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/figure-x-y.png">
  <img alt="Figure X.Y. Caption text here." src="assets/figure-x-y.png">
</picture>
Figure X.Y. Caption text here.

**Requirements**: Anchor BEFORE picture element, both themes, full alt text, plain caption below

5. **ANCHOR GENERATION AND HEADING HIERARCHY**:
   - **Chapter headers (level 1)**: # Chapter Title <a id="chapter-X"></a>
   - **Main sections (level 1)**: ## 2.1 Section Title <a id="section-2-1"></a>
   - **Subsections (level 2)**: ### 2.1.1 Subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1"></a>
   - **Sub-subsections (level 3)**: #### 2.1.1.1 Sub-subsection Title <a id="section-2-1-1-1"></a>
   - **CRITICAL**: Use correct heading depth based on section numbering depth
   - Figures: <a id="figure-2-1"></a> before figure elements
   - Equations: <a id="equation-2-1"></a> before equation blocks
   - Tables: <a id="table-2-1"></a> before table content

6. **CROSS-REFERENCES**:
   - Figures: [Figure 2.1](#figure-2-1), [Fig. 2.1](#figure-2-1)
   - Equations: [equation (2.1)](#equation-2-1), [Eq. (2.1)](#equation-2-1)
   - Tables: [Table 2.1](#table-2-1), [Tab. 2.1](#table-2-1)
   - Sections: [Section 2.1](#section-2-1), [Sec. 2.1](#section-2-1)
   - References: [Author (Year)](#bib-author-year)

7. **PDF TEXT GUIDANCE**: Use this extracted text to verify accuracy and completeness:

Acoustic Problem.
Using a similar argument the SHIE for the interior problem can be derived:
In terms of integral operator notation the boundary integral equations on the surface S,
are given by,
Exterior:
Interior:
2.3.2 Differentiated Surface Helmholtz' Integral Equation
The SHIE taken on the boundary surface may be differentiated with respect to the normal
at P to obtain the Differentiated surface Helmholtz' integral equation (DSHIE),
There is also a DSHIE for the interior problem and the differentiated integral equations can be
written in terms of integral operators,
