### 2.2.1 Greens Function <a id="section-2-2-1"></a>

In general, when a differential equation is transformed into an integral equation, the form of the integral equation not only depends on the governing differential equation, but the boundary conditions specific to the problem. An integral equation not only relates an unknown function to its derivatives; i.e. values at neighbouring points, but also to its values at the boundary. The boundary conditions are built into an integral equation through the form of its kernel, but for a differential equation, the boundary conditions are imposed at the final stage of solution. This kernel is the Green’s function for the problem.

For the acoustic problem, the Green’s function is the fundamental solution of the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation.

$$
\begin{align*}
(\nabla^2 + k^2) G_k(P, Q) &= -\delta(P, Q).
\tag{2.2.1}
\end{align*}
$$

where $\delta(P, Q)$ is the delta-dirac function. Also, the Green’s function must satisfy Sommerfeld’s radiation condition, Eq. (2.1.13). The appropriate solution in three dimensions is given by,

$$
G_k(P, Q) = \frac{e^{ikr}}{4\pi r}, \quad r = |P - Q|.
\tag{2.2.2}
$$

In this equation, $r$ is the Euclidean distance between the field points $P$ and $Q$.
