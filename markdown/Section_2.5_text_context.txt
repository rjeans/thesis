Acoustic Problem.
2.4.4 Boundary layer formulations
The boundary layer formulations for the exterior acoustic problem also exhibit similar non-
uniqueness properties at the critical wavenumbers described above. A similar argument to show
this non-uniqueness to that for the SHIE and DSHIE can be used. However another argument
is illustrated in figures (2.3) and (2.4). These arguments use the jump properties of the integral
operators derived in section (1.2.2),
Single layer:
Double layer:
The single layer formulation proves to be non-unique at eigenvalues of the interior Dirichlet
problem and the double layer formulation proves to be non-unique at eigenvalues of the interior
Neumann problem.
2.4.5 Hybrid boundary layer formulation
The established technique for overcoming the problem of uniqueness in a boundary layer
formulation is to express the surface velocity potential in terms of a hybrid combination of a
single and double layer surface distribution. The exterior velocity potential is defined by,
Consequently the boundary integral equations defining the acoustic problem are,
If the coupling constant, a is constrained to be imaginary, then the numerical solution of
this hybrid formulation is unique at all frequencies. Again the disadvantage of this formulation
is that it requires the integration of the hypersingular kernel in the Ne operator.
