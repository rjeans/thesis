CRITICAL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. **COMPLETE TEXT TRANSCRIPTION**: Read entire PDF content without missing any text
   - Include ALL sentences and paragraphs, especially transitional text between sections
   - Pay attention to continuation text that may appear before section headers
   - Do NOT skip connector sentences that provide context or bridge between topics
   - SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE: Any sentences that reference technical methods, formulations, or comparisons
   - Look for partial sentences or paragraphs that continue from the previous page

2. **INDIVIDUAL SECTION PROCESSING** (COMPLETE_SECTION):

   - **CRITICAL HEADING LEVEL**: Use ### for the main section header
   - Start with: ### 2.5.2 Edge conditions <a id="section-2-5-2"></a>
   - Process the complete section content

3. **MATHEMATICAL FORMATTING**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Inline equations: $variable$ (NOT \(variable\))
   - **CRITICAL**: Display equations (unnumbered): $$equation$$ (NOT \[equation\])
   - **CRITICAL**: Display equations (numbered): $$equation \tag{2.5.1}$$ or $$\begin{align*} equation \tag{2.5.1} \end{align*}$$

- For Appendix A2: figure-A2-1.png, figure-A2-2.png  
- For Appendix A1: figure-A1-1.png, figure-A1-2.png
**Requirements**: Anchor BEFORE picture element, both themes, full alt text, plain caption below

5. **TABLE FORMATTING**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Convert ALL tables to proper Markdown table format
   - **PRESERVE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE**: Maintain the exact layout and orientation from the PDF
   - Add anchor before table: `<a id="table-a2-1"></a>`
   - Use pipe-separated format with proper alignment:
     ```
     <a id="table-2-1"></a>
     
     | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
     |----------|----------|----------|
     | Value 1  | Value 2  | Value 3  |

Acoustic Problem.
Using these relationships, the SHIE formulation for the thin shell problem may be written as
By using the relationships in Eq. (2.5.1) and by setting @(p) = (p+) - d(P), the SHIE
and DSHIE formulations for the thin shell become,
The surface domain S is now the surface of one side of the thin shell. Since S has been
redefined the domains D and E need also to be redefined. The domain D becomes the domain
whose interface with S contains the points p, and E becomes the domain whose interface with
S contains the points pt. Both D and E are sub-domains of the exterior domain surrounding
S. Taking the limit of P to p in Eq. (2.5.3) and Eq. (2.5.4);
2.5.2 Edge conditions
When considering thin shells which do not enclose an interior volume it is important to
consider the behaviour of the integral equations at the edge of this shell. It has been proposed
in previous work (Warham (1988]) that by taking the limit of P to p in from D and E, results
in two equations that give a condition on &. However if the limits are taken correctly then,

Acoustic Problem.
which leads to the identity,
This equation simply states the fact that c-(P) = 1 - c+(p) and gives no condition on @. A
more sophisticated argument is needed to define the edge conditions for the open plate problem.
When the thickness of the plate is taken to zero the edge around the plate becomes an
additional boundary. Consequently there needs to be a supplementary boundary condition
specified on this boundary.In his recent paper Martin (1991) discusses the behaviour of one-
dimensional hypersingular integral equations over finite intervals and this idea is discussed in
more detail. This edge boundary condition is arbitrary in the mathematical sense, but for this
case is governed by the original physical problem. Continuity of the pressure difference across
the plate means that & must be zero at the edge of the shell;
p on the edge.
In past work (eg. Pierce [1987]), this edge boundary condition has been satisfied by the
choice of appropriate fluid basis functions. In most numerical work for arbitrary thin plates (e.g.
Terai (1981) and Warham (1988]) the edge boundary condition is essentially ignored since there
are no nodes on the edge of the plate. In the numerical work described in later chapters, the
presence of nodes on the edge of the plate means that this boundary condition must be imposed
upon the numerical formulation.

Collocation Method.
CHAPTER 3.
Collocation Method
3.1 Introduction
In this chapter a collocation method is described for the solution of radiation and scattering
problems for a submerged body of arbitrary geometry. A new way of numerically integrating
the hyper-singular kernels that occur in the boundary integral formulation is presented, and
the method is shown to be independent of the interpolation used for the fluid and geometrical
variables. Results for a selection of scattering and radiation problems show the validity and
accuracy of the method.
The problem of uniqueness at critical wavenumbers is circumvented by implementing the
method of Burton and Miller, described in the previous chapter. High order quadrilateral
elements are used to interpolate for the acoustic and geometric variables.
3.2 Discretization
3.2.1 Interpolation
A number of connecting elements are defined on the surface domain. The nodal points
defined by these elements form the set of collocation points at which the boundary integral
equations are satisfied. Within the elements, the approximate fluid and geometric variables are
related to the element nodal values in terms of element shape functions. The nodal positions
of the element are defined in terms of the global Cartesian axes (X,Y,Z), the local Cartesian
axes, (2,y,z), define the normal and tangential planes at the Gauss integration points and the
curvilinear axes, (§,n,§) define the element.
The approximations of global position and fluid variables are given in terms of the elemental
shape functions and element nodal values by,
In the definitions above, m represents the number of nodes per element.
