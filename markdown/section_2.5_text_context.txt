Acoustic Problem.
As the boundary layer formulation are related to the SHIE and the DSHIE, this hybrid
formulation is analogous to the Burton and Miller formulation described above.
2.5 Thin shell formulation
A prime motivation for this project was the analysis of thin shell acoustic problems. In this
work a thin shell is defined as a shell for which the through shell displacement field is assumed
to be constant. Acoustically this means that the normal derivative of pressure is the same on
both sides of the shell.
2.5.1 Boundary integral formulation
The geometry of the thin shell is illustrated in figure (2.5). On such a shell three closely
associated points may be defined. The points are p,p, and pt, where p represents a point
midway through the thickness of the shell, pt is a point on one surface, and p is the corre-
sponding point on the other surface. The normal my is defined to be in the direction from p
to pt. The Green's function and the normal derivative of Green's function at these points will
have the following simple relationships:
