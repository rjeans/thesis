## 2.4 Uniqueness of Boundary Integral Formulations <a id="section-2-4"></a>

In this section, we explore the uniqueness of boundary integral formulations in the context of acoustic problems. The integral operators defined on the surface $S$ result in solutions to the acoustic wave equation. By appropriately defining the Green's function, the solution satisfies the radiation condition, allowing the velocity potential in the exterior domain $E$ to be expressed in terms of a single layer distribution $\mu$.

$$
\phi(P) = \mathcal{L}_k[\mu](P), \quad P \in E. \tag{2.3.13}
$$

Differentiating with respect to a normal vector in the exterior domain yields the expression for the dimensionless velocity field:

$$
\frac{\partial \phi(P)}{\partial n_p} = \mathcal{M}^{T}_{E}[\mu](P), \quad P \in E. \tag{2.3.14}
$$

As the field point $P$ approaches the surface $S$, the boundary layer formulation for the acoustic problem is defined by:

$$
\left[\mathcal{M}^{T}_{S} - (1 - c(p))\right] \mu, \quad P \in S. \tag{2.3.15}
$$

Equation (2.3.15) can be solved for the single layer density $\mu$, enabling the evaluation of both exterior and surface velocity potentials. Similarly, the exterior velocity potential can be defined using a double layer distribution $\sigma$:

$$
\phi(P) = \mathcal{M}_k[\sigma](P), \quad P \in E. \tag{2.3.16}
$$

The differentiated form is:

$$
\frac{\partial \phi(P)}{\partial n_p} = \mathcal{K}_E[\sigma](P), \quad P \in E. \tag{2.3.17}
$$

Given that the $\mathcal{K}_E$ operator is continuous across the surface $S$, equation (2.3.17) can be utilized to solve for $P \in S$, thereby defining the surface velocity potential.
