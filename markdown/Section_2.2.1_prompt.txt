INDIVIDUAL SECTION INFORMATION:
- Context: CHAPTER 2. Acoustic Problem
- Section: 2.2.1 Greens Function
- Processing: individual subsection (pages 28-29)
- Content Type: Complete subsection with logical boundaries

EXPECTED SECTION STRUCTURE:
2.2.1 Greens Function

CRITICAL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. **COMPLETE TEXT TRANSCRIPTION**: Read entire PDF content without missing any text
   - Include ALL sentences and paragraphs, especially transitional text between sections
   - Pay attention to continuation text that may appear before section headers
   - Do NOT skip connector sentences that provide context or bridge between topics
   - SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE: Any sentences that reference technical methods, formulations, or comparisons
   - Look for partial sentences or paragraphs that continue from the previous page

2. **INDIVIDUAL SECTION PROCESSING** (COMPLETE_SECTION):
   - This is a complete subsection from a larger chapter
   - **CRITICAL HEADING LEVEL**: Use ### for the main section header
   - Start with: ### 2.2.1 Greens Function <a id="section-2-2-1"></a>
   - Process the complete section content

3. **MATHEMATICAL FORMATTING**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Inline equations: $variable$ (NOT \(variable\))
   - **CRITICAL**: Display equations (unnumbered): $$equation$$ (NOT \[equation\])
   - **CRITICAL**: Display equations (numbered): $$equation \tag{2.5.1}$$ or $$\begin{align*} equation \tag{2.5.1} \end{align*}$$
   - **CRITICAL**: ALL numbered equations MUST use \tag{} inside the $$ block
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER put equation numbers outside $$ like: $$equation$$ (2.5.1)
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER use \(variable\) or \[equation\] - these are forbidden
   - **CRITICAL**: Complex superscripts/subscripts must use braces: $\lambda_N^{{e_p}}$ NOT $\lambda_N^e_p$

   - **CRITICAL**: Convert ALL tables to proper Markdown table format
   - **PRESERVE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE**: Maintain the exact layout and orientation from the PDF
   - Add anchor before table: `<a id="table-a2-1"></a>`
   - Use pipe-separated format with proper alignment:
     ```
     <a id="table-2-1"></a>
     
     | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
     |----------|----------|----------|

   - Preserve all table data accurately, including numerical values and units
   - Maintain proper column alignment (left, center, right as appropriate)
   - Include complete table captions below the table
   - **DO NOT SKIP TABLES** - they contain important data that must be preserved

Acoustic Problem.
The consequence of this condition is that it allows outward travelling waves to be the only valid
physical solution for a radiated or scattered wave from a surface.
Eq. (2.1.10), Eq. (2.1.11) and Eq (2.1.13) uniquely define the acoustic problem. For
some simple geometries it is possible to solve the acoustic problem analytically, however for the
majority of realistic problems a numerical solution technique is needed. Analytical solutions for
certain problems are useful in establishing the accuracy of various numerical strategies used to
solve the acoustic problem.
At this stage the concept of a velocity potential function will be defined. This function
enables the fluid velocity and pressure fields to be evaluated from one potential function. The
function is defined by,
with,
2.2 Integral Operators
This work is concerned with various methods of numerical solution by means of boundary
element methods. Later in this chapter the appropriate integral equations will be derived that
form the basis of any BEM. The integral operators that will combine to give an integral for-
mulation of the acoustic problem are introduced in this section and a brief discussion of their
numerical properties is presented in isolation from the physical problem.
2.2.1 Green's Function
In general when a differential equation is transformed into an integral equation, the form of
the integral equation not only depends on the governing differential equation, but the boundary
conditions specific to the problem. An integral equation not only relates an unknown function

Acoustic Problem.
to its derivatives; ie values at neighbouring points, but also to its values at the boundary. The
boundary conditions are built into an integral equation through the form of its ernel, but for
a differential equation the boundary conditions are imposed at the final stage of solution. This
kernel is the Green's function for the problem.
For the acoustic problem, the Green's function is the fundamental solution of the inhomo
geneous Helmholtz' equation.
where S(P, Q) is the delta-dirac function. Also the Green's function must satisfy Sommerfeld's
radiation condition, Eq. (1.1.13). The appropriate solution in three dimensions is given by,
In this equation r is the Euclidean distance between the field points P and Q.
2.2.2 Discontinuities
The integral operators that are of interest are defined by.
The function & is assumed to be a continuous function over S. For completeness there is also
the identity operator,
An important property of these operators defined in Eq. (2.2.3-6) is that they are all solutions of
the original acoustic differential equation. Each can be thought of as the result of a continuous
distribution of sources, magnitude d(Q), over the surface of S.
